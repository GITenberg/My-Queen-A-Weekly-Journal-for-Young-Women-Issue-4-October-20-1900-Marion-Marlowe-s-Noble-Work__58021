<small>A TRIO OF DOCTORS.</small></h3>

<p>The College of Physicians and Surgeons,
or the “P. &amp; S.,” as it is usually called, had
just graduated a large class of promising
young doctors, and the morning after the
commencement exercises the big building
looked deserted. As Dr. Reginald Brookes,
a handsome young man of twenty-two,
passed down the steps, dress suit case in
hand, he came face to face with two of his
classmates.</p>

<p>“Hello, doc. What did you get, Charity or
Bellevue? I hear you competed,” called one
of the young doctors.</p>

<p>“Neither one,” said Dr. Brookes, with a
smile of amusement, “I got a berth in the
Penitentiary, Greenaway!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” said Dr. Fielding, a
pleasant-faced gentleman. “You’ll rust in
that place—they never have anything interesting!
Why, the best you will see will be
a few contusions and a case of cholera morbus
or eczema of some kind.”</p>

<p>Reginald Brookes still smiled, although he
knew his friend was speaking truthfully.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Bellevue, and I’m mighty
glad of it,” said Fielding, enthusiastically.
“For if there is anything going they get it at
Bellevue.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they catch it all, there,” was Dr.
Greenaway’s answer, “and it’s not so far
from the world as the Island, either.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s any number of pretty nurses
to flirt with,” he said, laughing. “No lack
of either fun or work in the wards of old
Bellevue.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you, Brookes,” exclaimed
Dr. Fielding again. “Why, you poor chap,
you’ll hardly see a pretty face where you are
going, for I understand that the prison
women do about all the nursing.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes, ‘Big Belle, the Confidence Queen,’ is
head nurse there now, I believe,” laughed
Brookes, “or at least she is guardian of the
woman’s ward just at present. I expect I’ll
have to leave my watch and money outside
when I go on duty. She might try her skill
on me, just to keep in practice.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am sorry for you, doc; still it is
better than no berth at all,” said Greenaway,
sadly, “I didn’t get a thing, and I’m the poorest
man in the college.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s too bad!” said Reginald
Brookes, with feeling. “But, say, what are
you going to do; you can’t go into general
practice without capital.”</p>

<p>Fred Greenaway shrugged his shoulders
and frowned slightly.</p>

<p>“I used up all I had on my education,” he
said, briefly, “but I’ll catch on to something.
I’m not worrying about it.”</p>

<p>Dick Fielding rushed away at that moment
in answer to a call from a friend, and in a
flash Dr. Brookes put his hand on Greenaway’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Let me lend you five thousand to start
with, old chap! I can do it as well as not,
and you can give me an I. O. U. for security.”</p>

<p>Fred Greenaway looked up at the handsome
fellow in amazement.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar! Do you mean that, doc?”
he asked, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said young Brookes, briefly,
as he drew a check book from his pocket.
“Why the deuce didn’t you tell me you were
hard up before. I thought you considered
me your friend, you rascal!”</p>

<p>Fred Greenaway did not speak for the
space of a minute. Such generosity as this
was totally unknown to him, and just at this
time it was doubly and trebly grateful.</p>

<p>“I guess I should have gone to the wall in
spite of my grit,” he said slowly, as Brookes
folded and handed him the check. “I
haven’t five dollars in my pocket this minute,
and as there wasn’t a ghost of a show in
sight for me to practice my profession, I was
starting out to apply for a job as motorman
on a street car, or something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“Let me know how you get on,” said
Brookes, as he waited for the I. O. U. that
Greenaway was scribbling. “I’ll be on the
Island for a year, I suppose, unless I find, as
Fielding says, that I am actually rusting.”</p>

<p>“But why do you go there, Brookes?”
asked his friend, rather anxiously. “With
your money, what is to hinder your going
straight into practice?”</p>

<p>Reginald Brookes did not answer the question
immediately; he appeared to be a little
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Fred!” he blurted out
finally, “but don’t give me away, old man, or
the boys will say I lack ambition; but the fact
is I’m in love—desperately in love, and it is
with a sweet little nurse who is ‘on probation’
in Charity.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Greenaway, with a smile of
amusement. “And you can’t bear the idea
of having the East River roll between you!
Well, I don’t know that I blame you, doc, for
after all, what’s the good of money if you
can’t be independent!”</p>

<p>“It is just this way,” said Brookes, seriously,
as the two friends started slowly up
Fifty-ninth street. “She is a beautiful girl,
a country lass, and fresh as a daisy. I’m
sure I don’t know how she can endure that
place, but she is determined to stay there and
take care of those poor wretches, and some
way I thought she would be happier if I went
over and helped her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how generous we are!” said Greenaway,
laughing. “You mean you knew you
would be happier on Blackwell’s Island with
her than you would on Fifth avenue with
any other woman.”</p>

<p>“I see you know how it is,” said young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Brookes, with a grin of sympathy. “You
are in love yourself, old boy, or you couldn’t
speak so feelingly.”</p>

<p>“I admit it,” said Greenaway, a sad look
crossing his face. “I’m in love all right, but
that is all the good it will ever do me.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?” asked Brookes, with a sudden
keen interest.</p>

<p>The frown deepened on Greenaway’s face
and his voice fell lower as he answered:
“Her name is May Osgood, and she is an
actress,” he said, slowly. “I have loved her
for some time—I can’t seem to get over it.”</p>

<p>That there was a reason why he should
get over it was very apparent by his words,
but Reginald Brookes was too cultured to
dream of asking his secret.</p>

<p>“Well, my little sweetheart is only seventeen,”
he said gayly, “and, between you and
I, she has not accepted me yet, so you see I
have a double reason for wishing to be near
her.”</p>

<p>As they parted at the L station, Greenaway
spoke rather suddenly.</p>

<p>“I’ll turn my life insurance over to you if
anything happens, Reg; but, by the way,
what is your sweetheart’s name? I seem to
have a feeling that I ought to know it.”</p>

<p>Reginald Brookes glanced at him in a little
surprise.</p>

<p>“Her name is Marion Marlowe,” he said,
very slowly, then, as Greenaway ran up the
stairs, he looked after him curiously.</p>

<p>“He’s a funny chap,” he muttered, uneasily.
“Now, why the deuce did he feel that
he ought to know my little sweetheart’s
name? Confound the fellow! He has no
business with such feelings!”</p>

<h3 title="II. A WORD OF WARNING">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>A WORD OF WARNING.</small></h3>

<p>Augustus Atherton, attorney-at-law, was
seated in his office looking over some papers.</p>

<p>Suddenly he tapped a bell upon his desk
and his office-boy entered.</p>

<p>“Tell Sands to bring me a copy of Halstead’s
testimony, Bob,” he said, shortly, “and
tell him to hurry; I want it this minute!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sands is out to lunch, sir, won’t be
back for half an hour,” said the boy, respectfully,
“but Miss Marlowe has the copy; shall
I tell her to bring it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at once,” said the lawyer, wheeling
around in his chair.</p>

<p>In less than a minute his “typewriter girl”
entered the office.</p>

<p>“Here is the paper, sir,” said a sweet, low
voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Atherton looked up and then stared a
little. It was the first time he had really
taken a good look at the new copyist.</p>

<p>The young girl who stood before him was
very beautiful. She had a sweet, oval face,
lighted by violet eyes, and her rippling
golden hair shone like threads of sunshine.</p>

<p>Her figure was plump, but exceedingly
graceful, and every curve was enhanced by
the charming simplicity of her garments.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” he said politely, as she
laid the papers upon the desk, and at the
same time he looked admiringly at her small
white hand and taper fingers.</p>

<p>“You copy very neatly and accurately,
Miss Marlowe,” he said quickly, as she was
about to turn respectfully and leave him.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said the beautiful girl,
blushing. “I am very glad, indeed, that I
please you. It is my first position and I am
naturally a little nervous.”</p>

<p>“You have never worked in an office before,
then,” said the old lawyer, glancing her
over critically. “Well, you are doing nicely,
and Sands tells me you are very rapid.”</p>

<p>“I do manage the typewriter very easily,
sir,” said the young girl, smiling, “and I am
studying very hard. I shall soon be a stenographer.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have you in here where I can
dictate to you,” said the lawyer, quickly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>“By Jove! What a treat that will be after
two years of Miss Dixon!”</p>

<p>His extraordinary manner astonished the
girl a little, but after a moment of embarrassment
she managed to stammer:</p>

<p>“Oh, but I may never be as proficient as
Miss Dixon; she takes notes like lightning,
while I can only write fifty words a minute.”</p>

<p>“Well, I could talk slower,” said the lawyer,
slyly, giving her another sharp look over
his glasses.</p>

<p>Dollie Marlowe smiled, but she was considerably
puzzled. It was the longest conversation
that she had had with her employer.</p>

<p>For she had only been working two weeks,
and it was the first position of any kind that
she had ever occupied.</p>

<p>She was only seventeen, but quite large for
her age, and up to a few months before had
always lived in the country.</p>

<p>As she bowed politely to the lawyer and
hurried away from his desk, she could not
help wondering if he had guessed just how
green and simple she was, and whether his
words were intended for anything more than
kindly encouragement.</p>

<p>When she reached the little office where
her typewriter stood, Dollie went on with
her work as steadily as ever, but more than
once she caught herself thinking of her employer’s
words and wondering if he really
did want her to sit in his office.</p>

<p>Dollie Marlowe’s life in the city had not
been without its experiences, and at times
there was a cloud on the fair girl’s brow as
though some of those experiences had been
woefully bitter.</p>

<p>She rarely said anything about her own
life, but the name of her twin sister was frequently
on her lips, and this sister was now
a nurse in Charity Hospital.</p>

<p>“My sister Marion is as beautiful as a
saint,” she had told Miss Dixon. “She has
magnificent gray eyes and such a queenly
air. Oh, I could talk forever and not tell
half of Marion’s virtues!”</p>

<p>“If she is prettier than you are she must
be beautiful,” Miss Dixon had said, honestly.
She was one of the few plain women who
could see beauty in others and admit it.</p>

<p>She came into the little office while Dollie
was working, only a few minutes after the
talk with Mr. Atherton.</p>

<p>“There is a boy out in the hall looking for
you, Miss Marlowe,” she said, pleasantly,
“and I should judge by his looks that he had
some important news. Oh, no, not bad news,
I am sure!” she added, as she saw the change
in Dollie’s face. “He was grinning and
showing every tooth in his head. A mighty
nice-looking boy, too; perhaps he is your
sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“My sweetheart is not a boy, Miss Dixon,”
said Dollie, proudly. “He is twenty years old
and is a bookkeeper at a good salary. This
must be Bert Jackson, one of my old neighbors
in the country.”</p>

<p>She rose from her machine and hurried out
into the hall. Sure enough, there stood Bert,
very impatient, but still grinning.</p>

<p>“I just dropped in to tell you the good
news,” said Bert, as quick as he saw her.
“I’ve been adopted by a rich man, and I’m
to have my choice of a future profession.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, how lovely!” cried Dollie, enthusiastically.
She could hardly believe that
such good fortune had befallen him.</p>

<p>“His name is Captain Hobart, and he’s a
millionaire, I am told,” went on Bert. “I
used to always wait on him at the store where
I worked, and he tells me he took a fancy to
me because of my good manners. How
Matt Jenkins, the keeper of the Poor Farm,
would swear if he could hear that,” he said,
roaring. “That’s doing pretty well for an
orphan boy to be adopted by a millionaire,
isn’t it, Dollie?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh, it’s just beautiful!” cried Dollie, in
genuine delight. “Oh, I just wish all of the
boys from the Poor Farm could have such
a chance! Marion will be overjoyed to hear
of it, Bert. I shall write to her this evening
and tell her about it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve done that already,” was Bert’s
prompt reply. “You didn’t suppose I’d let
her hear it second-hand, did you? And, by
the way, Dollie, I’ve got a secret for your
ears. It has just come to me lately, and I’m
as happy as a lark. I’m going straight ahead
to make love to Marion. She’s the dearest
girl I know, and I’m going to ask her to
marry me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert!”</p>

<p>This was all that Dollie could say. She
was quite overcome with astonishment at
this matter-of-fact announcement.</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t I,” asked Bert, in an
injured tone. “Of course I don’t expect her to
marry me now, but as soon as I am educated
and have plenty of ‘dough’ I don’t see any
reason why she shouldn’t like me.”</p>

<p>Dollie Marlowe burst out laughing, in
spite of Bert’s seriousness.</p>

<p>“But don’t you know that Marion has two
lovers already?” she asked, gayly. “Why,
she’ll have time to marry both of them before
you are old enough to ask her.”</p>

<p>“I’m as old as she is, and I’ll take chances
on that,” said Bert, coolly; “but I say, Dollie,
who the mischief is this bald-headed old
duffer?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered the girl in horror, as
she saw who was coming. “That is Mr.
Atherton, my honorable employer.”</p>

<p>“Honorable fiddlesticks!” said Bert, staring
straight at the gentleman. “Look out
for him, Dollie; I don’t like his style. He’s
too smooth to be real healthy, and you know
I must protect you, if you are going to be
my sister.”</p>

<h3 title="III. MARION ARRIVES JUST IN TIME">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>MARION ARRIVES JUST IN TIME.</small></h3>

<p>At exactly noon the day after Bert Jackson’s
warning, Miss Dixon sat alone in the
private office.</p>

<p>She had been taking dictation all the morning,
and was a trifle weary.</p>

<p>“It is very strange,” she said to herself.
“Mr. Atherton is not in the habit of taking
his typewriter to lunch with him, and I have
been here two years and never received an
invitation.”</p>

<p>Bob Day, the office boy, came in with some
papers. There was a grin on his face as he
laid them on the desk.</p>

<p>“He’s mashed on her, sure pop!” he said,
with great jubilation. “You just ought to
seen him smirk at her when they went down
in the elevator.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Miss Dixon, sharply.
“You must be mistaken, Bob. Mr. Atherton
was never known to take one of us to luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you ain’t all got her style,” said
the boy, unfeelingly. “Why, Miss Marlowe
is a peach! She’s got all of us stuck on
her.”</p>

<p>“Much good will it do her,” said Miss
Dixon, sadly. “She’s too pretty for her own
good—that’s what I’ve often told her.”</p>

<p>“She’ll wear diamonds if she sticks to me,”
sang out Bob, as he went noisily out of the
office.</p>

<p>Just outside in the hall he met a beautiful
young girl. She had chestnut hair and large,
flashing gray eyes, and carried her head and
shoulders regally.</p>

<p>“Did you want ter see Mr. Atherton?”
asked Bob, quickly. He had seen that she
was a stranger, and he was the guardian of
the office.</p>

<p>“I am looking for Miss Marlowe, his typewriter,”
said the beautiful girl, sweetly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>“Miss Marlowe is my twin sister, and I am
in a great hurry to see her.”</p>

<p>The boy glanced up at the clock in the
hall.</p>

<p>“Sorry, miss, but she is out to lunch,” he
said, briefly. “Won’t be back for at least
two hours, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“What! Does my sister spend so much
time over her luncheon as that?” asked the
young girl, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Well, not usually,” was the answer, in a
drawling voice, “but she’s out with the boss
to-day, you see, so I give ’em two hours.
They can’t get back no sooner.”</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe gasped at this bit of information,
but she controlled herself perfectly
in the presence of this youngster.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know where they
went?” she said, pleasantly, at the same time
handing the boy a bright half dollar.</p>

<p>“He’d kill me if he knew I told,” Bob said,
as he pocketed the money, “but it’s either the
Astor House or Moquin’s in Fulton street,
miss. If ’twas me, I’d go to the Astor House
first. It’s nicer over there and not so far as
the other.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him and turned away,
with a curious feeling at her heart. There
was something in the boy’s news that worried
her sadly.</p>

<p>“I seen ’em cuttin’ across the Park,” muttered
Bob, after she had gone, “but she can’t
say I told her. I said either one or t’other.”</p>

<p>As the beautiful young girl picked her way
across Park Row, more than one person
stared at her. There was a freshness and
stateliness about her that is not often seen in
city maidens.</p>

<p>As yet the country bloom was still dyeing
her cheeks, and the marvelous whiteness of
her skin was good to behold.</p>

<p>She had passed through many trials since
she came to the city, acting the part of heroine
on several occasions, yet each time withdrawing
herself and her noble deeds as rapidly
as possible into the background.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” she whispered, as
she hurried across the Park. “Oh, my poor
little sister; how thoughtless she is! Why, it
would break Ralph Moore’s heart if he
thought Dollie was fickle.”</p>

<p>Ralph Moore was Dollie’s sweetheart, and
they were to be married soon—just as soon
as Ralph’s position admitted of the change—and
Marion already loved him as she would
her own brother.</p>

<p>She knew that Dollie was only a child in
heart, the baby of the family, and very unsophisticated,
but she had not believed that she
would be so really careless of Ralph’s feelings
as to accept attention from her employer.
Marion was thinking deeply as she
reached Broadway, but as she stepped on the
crossing she paused to look about her.</p>

<p>Not ten feet away she saw one of the new
automobile carriages, and as she glanced at
it carelessly she recognized one of the occupants.</p>

<p>It was George Colebrook, a man whom she
had reason to despise, for he had played the
traitor in a love affair with her dear friend,
Alma Allyn, and such actions as this always
shocked her pure nature.</p>

<p>He was looking straight at her with an
ugly gleam in his eyes, and Marion noticed
that his companion was a flashily dressed
woman.</p>

<p>“He hates me, I believe,” thought Marion
to herself, “and all because I showed him
how I loathed him. If looks could kill, I
should certainly die this minute, and yet that
black-hearted fellow once dared to make love
to me! Oh, how I despise such treacherous
creatures!”</p>

<p>When Marion reached the Astor House
dining-room, she stood perfectly still and
looked around.</p>

<p>A dozen people turned their heads and
commented on her beauty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>Dollie and her employer were not there,
so Marion made her way to the parlor. The
instant she looked in, she saw Dollie sitting
by the window.</p>

<p>Marion walked over to her quickly and put
her hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>With a little scream of surprise, Dollie
turned and looked at her; the next second
they were hugging and kissing each other.</p>

<p>There was only one person besides themselves
in the parlor just then, so for a minute
the girls talked freely, but in low tones so
as not to attract attention.</p>

<p>“But, sister, what are you doing here?”
asked Marion, after a little. “I went to the
office and could not find you, and the office
boy told me you were lunching with your
employer.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how he knew?” remarked Dollie,
innocently. “Why, I came out five minutes
before him and waited at the elevator.
That boy is very impudent to be watching
us,” she added.</p>

<p>“And your employer is very thoughtless
to invite you out with him,” said Marion,
stoutly. “A man of his age ought to know
better, Dollie.”</p>

<p>“But he did not mean anything by it, Marion,”
said Dollie, quickly. “Why, he is as
nice as he can be, and he’s almost as old as
father.”</p>

<p>“That is what I said; he is old enough to
know better,” said Marion, grimly; “but here
he comes, Dollie; I know him by your description.”</p>

<p>“Yes, here he comes,” repeated the fair-haired
girl, gayly, “and I do so hope he has
arranged everything satisfactorily. He is
going to take me to a matinee, and I’ll make
him take you, too. He won’t mind, I am
sure, for he has plenty of money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Atherton looked surprised when he
saw Dollie talking to a magnificent young
woman, and he smiled more blandly than ever
when the blushing girl introduced them.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to meet you, I am sure,”
he said, with a gallant bow to Dollie’s sister.</p>

<p>“And I am delighted to meet you also,
sir,” said Marion, coldly, “for it gives me an
opportunity to tell you what I think of you!”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="IV. MARION MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>MARION MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT.</small></h3>

<p>Dollie Marlowe gasped at her sister’s
words, and for a moment even the wily old
lawyer looked a little disconcerted.</p>

<p>“I am sure I hope you do not think ill
of me,” he said, politely. “I was only taking
your sister for a little outing. She is
as safe with me as she would be with her
own father.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless you have not considered the
risk to her reputation,” said Marion, calmly.
“Dollie is your typewriter; she is in your
employ. It is not proper at all for you to
make a companion of her.”</p>

<p>“But if I choose to, Miss Marlowe, surely
there can be no harm. And as for the opinion
of the world, what does that amount to?”</p>

<p>“It amounts to a great deal to a poor
girl,” was the quick answer. “A man may
shock the proprieties all he pleases, but the
woman who does so will always have to
suffer. We must take the world as we find
it, sir, and conform to its edicts.”</p>

<p>“Then you think it is wrong for your sister
to eat her lunch with me?” he asked,
with a slight sneer. “Perhaps you imagine
that her employer is not respectable?”</p>

<p>“I mean, sir,” said the brave girl, firmly,
“that I love my sister dearly, and that I
will not knowingly allow her fair name to
be sullied. She is engaged to be married,
sir, to a noble young man. What do you
suppose he would say to your remarks
about the luncheon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, if she is tied to some whipper-snapper,
and dares not say her soul is her
own——” he began, angrily, but Marion interrupted
in the same calm manner.</p>

<p>“She is engaged to a gentleman and she
means to marry him, consequently I can see
no reason why she should desire your company;
and as for her lunches, the salary you
pay her should provide her with those necessaries.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to all this?” asked the
lawyer, suddenly, as he turned to Dollie, who
was leaning weakly against the window.</p>

<p>“I think Marion is right,” said the young
girl, slowly, “but I’m sure, sir, she doesn’t
mean to hurt your feelings. It is her love
for me that makes her so decided.”</p>

<p>“You need not apologize for me, Dollie,”
said Marion, scornfully; “your employer
knows that I am perfectly right, but to
prove it I will ask him what he thinks his
wife would say if she had interrupted this
matinee plan as I did.”</p>

<p>She was looking the lawyer steadily in
the face as she spoke, and the wide gray
eyes seemed to see right through him.</p>

<p>The man’s sallow cheeks grew scarlet at
her question, but, with a shrug of his shoulders,
he turned toward Dollie.</p>

<p>“I will bid you good-day, Miss Dollie,”
he said, smilingly; “when you have graduated
from your sister’s tuition, you will find
life much more pleasant.” He left the room
without so much as a glance at Marion, who
now stood half smiling beside her sister.</p>

<p>“Thee did that well,” said a voice near
Marion. She turned and saw an old gentleman
who had been sitting quietly at a
little distance. He wore the garb of a
Quaker.</p>

<p>“You heard it, sir?” asked Marion,
quickly.</p>

<p>The old gentleman bowed, and smiled a
little sadly.</p>

<p>“I heard and saw it all,” he said, quietly.
“I give thee my word I could not move
away from that corner. I was so interested
in the outcome that I deliberately remained
to hear it.”</p>

<p>“And you approve of my action?” asked
Marion, as she studied his face closely.</p>

<p>“I do, indeed, daughter,” said the Quaker,
firmly. “Thy sister is an innocent—protect
her always, particularly from such men, who
are but wolves in sheep’s clothing.”</p>

<p>“That is what I thought,” said Marion, as
he moved away. “Come Dollie, let us go!
This is no place for country maidens.”</p>

<p>“I don’t dare go back to the office,” said
Dollie, as they went out; “he will be as
angry as possible, and perhaps he will discharge
me. Oh! Marion, what was the
harm? Why couldn’t I go to the matinee?”</p>

<p>Marion drew a deep breath; she was sorely
puzzled. Sometimes it seemed to her that
Dollie was almost lacking in understanding.</p>

<p>“Dollie! Dollie!” she said, earnestly, “how
can you be so foolish? As if you cared so
much about a matinee that you would hurt
Ralph’s feelings by going with your employer!
Is it not better to deny yourself a
little pleasure than to take such risks with
your future happiness?”</p>

<p>“Ralph isn’t so small as to care, I am
sure,” said Dollie, panting; “and oh, Marion,
I am so sorry you talked as you did!
I think you were awfully rude to poor Mr.
Atherton!”</p>

<p>Marion bit her lips, and her eyes filled
with tears. She was realizing keenly her
responsibility as a sister. She should never,
never have left Dollie unprotected.</p>

<p>“Miss Allyn warned you,” she said, almost
to herself. “She is a wise woman, Dollie.
If you cannot trust me, why not trust
Miss Allyn? I would never have left you
with her if I had not supposed you would
listen to her.”</p>

<p>“Miss Allyn is too suspicious; she is like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>you,” said Dollie, spitefully. “She always
sees something wrong in a gentleman’s attentions.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Dollie,” said Marion, almost facing
her in the street. “Alma Allyn is a
great deal wiser than either you or I. She
has lived in a city always, and met hundreds
of men; we know she is our friend—then
why can we not trust her? You know that
she warned you about that very thing—about
lunches and theatres with your employer,
Dollie!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I know that she goes to lunches
and theatres with gentlemen whenever she
pleases,” answered Dollie, triumphantly;
“and I fail to see why I can’t go, Marion.”</p>

<p>There was another sigh from the anxious
sister. Would Dollie never understand that
she was only a ewe lamb, while Alma Allyn
was a woman of wisdom and experience?</p>

<p>As they started across the street both girls
were thinking deeply, so deeply that for once
they did not use their customary caution.</p>

<p>There were trucks and street cars and carriages
in profusion, but in a second the girls
were in the very middle of the crossing.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled some one, almost in
Marion’s ear, and the next instant it seemed
as if a dozen voices echoed it.</p>

<p>Marion was just ahead of Dollie, and as
she looked up quickly she saw a heavy express
wagon with two powerful horses bearing
straight down upon her.</p>

<p>There was a street car just ahead, so she
darted back, but the next second she saw
that she had not bettered her position.</p>

<p>An automobile carriage was coming from
the opposite direction—it would not be possible
for both girls to pass it.</p>

<p>Dollie gave a shriek and stopped abruptly,
but in that second her sister had recovered
full possession of her senses.</p>

<p>One hasty glance at the horseless vehicle
showed her that the occupant was George
Colebrook. He was alone now, and his expression
was one of diabolical hatred.</p>

<p>With one fearful effort, she grasped Dollie
by the shoulders, and, running a couple of
steps, gave her a push with all the force at
her command, which sent her head first into
the arms of a big policeman. Then Marion
turned to follow, but she was a second too
late. The fellow on the automobile seemed
merciless in his intentions.</p>

<p>As the clumsy carriage came bounding
onward, there was no escape.</p>

<p>With a stifled groan Marion went down
before it.</p>

<h3 title="V. THE SECRET PROMISE">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE SECRET PROMISE.</small></h3>

<p>When Marion Marlowe returned to consciousness
she was lying on a cot in the
ward of a hospital.</p>

<p>She was considerably dazed as yet, and
looked around inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Dear me, what am I doing here?” she
said, dreamily. “Why am I lying here, when
I ought to be on duty?”</p>

<p>“You have met with a slight accident,”
said a pleasant voice very near her, as a
white-capped nurse appeared. “You are in
Chambers Street Hospital, not Charity, Miss
Marlowe.”</p>

<p>Marion tried to sit up, and partially succeeded.
In a very few moments she remembered
everything distinctly.</p>

<p>“Was my sister hurt?” she asked at once.
“Oh, do tell me if anything happened to Dollie!”</p>

<p>“No, she escaped unharmed,” was the
prompt reply. “Your brave action saved her,
my dear Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>Marion leaned back on her pillow with an
exclamation of gratitude. She did not care
for herself, but thought only of Dollie.</p>

<p>“You have been here twenty-four hours
now,” said the nurse very quietly, “but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>consider you marvelously lucky to have escaped
as you did. Fortunately, that horseless
carriage struck a stone at that instant
and swerved a little, which saved not only
your life, but your bones, Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>Marion smiled very sweetly. It did not
alarm her to hear what had happened. She
was not suffering at all, only she felt bruised
and lame.</p>

<p>“The careless fellow was arrested,” went
on the nurse, quietly, “but he swore that he
had lost control of the carriage, and as they
did not hold him, of course you can have him
re-arrested at any time you wish. I believe
he gave them his name and address.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’ll not bother!” said the sick
girl, quickly. She was thinking of her friend,
the woman who had loved this fellow, and
for her sake she did not mean to follow up
the matter. It did not occur to her then to
question the nurse about the extent of her injuries,
but in a few moments she began thinking
about her duties.</p>

<p>“Did my sister wire the superintendent at
Charity?” she asked, very anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, and both Dr. Hall and Miss Williams
wired back their regrets. They said
for you not to worry, but just get well as
soon as possible. And I guess you are going
to mind them,” she added, with a smile,
“for now that the shock to the brain has
passed, I hope to send you home to your
friends very shortly.”</p>

<p>There was a little rustle of skirts and a
light footstep coming down the ward.</p>

<p>“Is she better?” asked a cheery voice from
the other side of the bed.</p>

<p>Marion recognized it instantly and turned
her head on the pillow. The lady who stood
beside her was her dear friend, Alma Allyn.
Miss Allyn was a woman of twenty-five, fine-looking,
stylish and far wiser than the average.</p>

<p>She was a newspaper reporter, with an excellent
position, and had befriended the two
country girls ever since they came to the
city.</p>

<p>“We’ll take you right up to Harlem to the
flat now,” she said, as she kissed Marion
fondly, “and I’ll have a nurse to take care of
you until you are well, unless Dollie insists
on giving up her position.”</p>

<p>“Then she did not lose it?” said Marion,
in surprise.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn looked grave, but she tried to
speak cheerfully.</p>

<p>“No, she did not lose it, in spite of your
plain speech, Marion. Such men as her employer
do not give up their projects so easily,
but this accident of yours has made her do a
little thinking. I fancy her lover will have
no cause to complain of her in future.”</p>

<p>“Poor Ralph,” sighed Marion, “I pity him
sometimes! Dollie is such a child! Really,
I am almost sorry there is an engagement.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let it worry you,” said Miss Allyn,
brightly, “and, now, before I go, I am going
to tell you some good news. Your friend,
Mr. Ray, is back in town, and you have no
idea how anxious he is to see you.”</p>

<p>The sweet face on the pillow flushed slightly
at her words, and a little smile brought
out two bewitching dimples.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad!” Marion murmured,
with a happy look in her eyes, and just then
the nurse came over and dismissed her
friend pleasantly.</p>

<p>As Marion lay on her cot she had ample
time to think, and there were many subjects
just now that were clamoring for attention.
Here they were, she and Dollie, in the great
city of New York, without friends or money,
except what their own efforts brought to
them.</p>

<p>Still, through these very efforts she had
already accomplished a little.</p>

<p>Her first triumph has been in saving her
sister from a villain’s clutches; another, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>heroic act of saving a life, had brought her
sufficient money to pay off the mortgage on
the old homestead in the country and so save
her parents from a home at the Poor Farm.
But aside from these bright spots, it had
been all sorrow and suffering, but Marion
had hoped it was all over when Dollie secured
the position in Lawyer Atherton’s office,
and she, herself, was accepted as a
nurse in Charity Hospital.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn had fitted up a cosy little flat
in Harlem and taken Dollie to live with her,
and Miss Allyn was so wise and so fond of
the girl, Marion’s heart was full of gratitude
toward the noble woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dollie, my poor, weak sister!” she
whispered to herself, “why is it you cannot
learn to trust those who are wiser than you?
Have you not had bitterness enough already
in your young life, but that you must persist
in wilfully inviting more sorrow?”</p>

<p>It was a happy moment when Mr. Ray and
his sister were announced. They were the
first friends she had made in the city, but
they had been abroad almost from the week
they met, and their homecoming brought a
pleasure that was most wonderfully sweet
and consoling.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe! Marion!” cried Adele
Ray, as she clasped Marion in her arms.
“How glad I am to see you again, but how
unutterably unpleasant to find you in a hospital!”</p>

<p>“As brave as ever, I hear,” were Archie
Ray’s first words, as he extended both hands
and grasped the girl’s slim fingers.</p>

<p>Marion gazed from one to the other in
eager delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so happy!” she murmured over
and over, “and I am going home to-morrow,
so you will not have to see me here again,
Adele. I know it must have been a shock to
you to see me in a hospital.”</p>

<p>The two girls chatted together, while
Archie Ray looked on. He was a tall, handsome
young man, with dark, pleading eyes,
and possessed a charmingly aristocratic
manner.</p>

<p>He had been deeply in love with Marion
before he went abroad, and now, when he
saw her again, all the old tenderness came
back to him, and he longed almost uncontrollably
to press her to his bosom.</p>

<p>But if Marion read his thoughts, she did
not show it by so much as a glance. There
was an open cordiality in her manner that
baffled him completely.</p>

<p>Suddenly Adele Ray’s face grew clouded
in the midst of their talking. It was evident
to Marion that she was thinking of something
unpleasant.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion, dear, I want you to help us,”
she said, slowly. “We have a terrible secret
for your ears, but it has to be told, and the
sooner the better. We want you to do us
a favor, my brother and I, and, oh, Marion,
dear, do give us your sympathy!”</p>

<p>She looked so distressed that Marion’s
cheeks grew pale, but she took Miss Ray’s
hand and held it tightly.</p>

<p>Archie Ray bit his lips and his face clouded
a little. He had been momentarily dreading
this particular moment, for he knew what
was coming and would almost have given
his life to have prevented it.</p>

<p>“I will help you gladly,” Marion whispered
quickly. “There is nothing you would
ask that I would not willingly promise.”</p>

<p>The fair girl little realized the blow which
she was about to receive, else she could hardly
have smiled as bravely as she did at that
minute.</p>

<p>Adele Ray leaned over and whispered
something in her ear, and as Marion listened
her cheeks grew as pale as death itself.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” she murmured, in a far-away
voice, and then her wavering eyes met
the glance of Adele Ray’s brother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>The sadness in those dark eyes went
straight to Marion’s heart. In an instant her
own grief was put aside and she was willing
to bear anything for this fond, noble brother.</p>

<p>As she answered Adele’s appeal, she still
looked at her brother and the words, “I will
do it,” were said to him. To him she had
given her sacred, secret promise.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3 title="VI. MARION’S STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>MARION’S STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.</small></h3>

<p>It was Reginald Brookes who sent a carriage
for Marion on the day that she was
allowed to leave the Chambers St. Hospital
to return for a few days to the little flat in
Harlem.</p>

<p>Through some mysterious medium he had
heard of Mr. Ray and was determined if possible
to outdo his rival in kind attentions to
Marion.</p>

<p>“I’ll never stoop to anything but a fair
fight,” he said to his mother, “and as this
Mr. Ray is a gentleman, I have no doubt
but that he is honorable. She must choose
between us; when she does I shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“You are as noble as you are sensible, my
son,” was his mother’s fond answer, “and
Miss Marlowe is not the girl, I am sure, to
be fickle in her decision.”</p>

<p>When Dr. Brookes reached the little
flat to welcome Marion back from the hospital,
he found Dollie and Miss Allyn much
worried.</p>

<p>“Marion should have been here at five
o’clock,” said Dollie, half crying. “Miss
Allyn telephoned and learned that she left
the hospital at four, and now just look, it
is nearly seven!”</p>

<p>“Something must have happened!” said
Miss Allyn, soberly, “but how shall we find
out, that is the question, doctor?”</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes paced the floor in the greatest
consternation. He looked at his watch repeatedly,
and seemed to be figuring something.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp ring of the bell made
their hearts beat wildly. Dollie rushed out
in the hall and came face to face with Bert
Jackson.</p>

<p>“You are all scared to death about Marion,
aren’t you?” he began, abruptly; “well,
you needn’t worry, she’ll probably be here
in a minute! There was a drunken woman
fighting in the street down town and of
course Marion had to stop and take a hand
in the scrimmage. Oh! I don’t mean that
she did any of the scrapping!” he explained
as he saw their astonished faces, “but she
just put a stop to the row and then hauled
that woman into her cab and took her to
her home, and that’s what has detained
her!”</p>

<p>“It’s just like Marion!” cried Dollie,
laughing.</p>

<p>“It was dreadful risky,” said Miss Allyn,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>“It is awful!” cried Dr. Brookes, almost
frantic as he thought of it. “Why, the girl
will be robbed or killed if she doesn’t stop
doing for such common people!”</p>

<p>“You ought to have seen her,” said Bert,
who was bristling with admiration. “There
was a big crowd all around the woman, who
was dancing and yelling, and just as the
carriage drove by a policeman charged into
the crowd and was going to grab the woman
when she jabbed a hat pin into him. Wow!
but you ought to have heard him howl!
The mob gave him the laugh and that made
him madder, and in a jiffy he yanked his
club out of his belt and made a lunge at
her—and he’d have knocked her silly if it
hadn’t been for Marion!”</p>

<p>“What did she do?” asked Dollie, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Do! Why, she just threw open the carriage
door and stood on the step; then her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>voice rang out like a silver bugle as she
cried: ‘Don’t you dare to strike that woman,
officer! Shame on you, you brute! I will
report your conduct!’”</p>

<p>“And then what happened?” asked Miss
Allyn, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Then the ‘cop’ fell back and looked
ashamed of himself, and Marion jumped
down from the carriage and started for the
woman and the crowd made way for her as
though she was an empress—and she didn’t
look unlike one, either, you bet, for her
head was up in the air and her eyes just
shot sparks at them! Oh, Marion just
knocked them speechless! I tell you she is a
dandy!”</p>

<p>“Go on with your story!” said Dr. Brookes,
still anxiously. “I want to know exactly
what happened after that.”</p>

<p>“Why, Marion got hold of the woman and
coaxed her to the carriage and when the
woman told her where she lived she ordered
the driver to go there and my! how the
crowd yelled when they drove off together.”</p>

<p>“Then there is no knowing where she is
now?” said Dr. Brookes, hastily. “The
brave girl may have been imposed upon by
the drunken woman! Have you any idea
what address she gave her?”</p>

<p>Bert Jackson looked crestfallen for about
a minute, then a ray of joy illumined his
features.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t near enough to hear the address,”
he said, quickly. “You see, I was
riding by with my adopted father, and it was
only by a good bit of coaxing that I made
him let me off, but a man in the crowd told
me that the woman was May Osgood, and
that she was an actress from some theatre
or other.”</p>

<p>“Great Heavens! Greenaway’s sweetheart!”
cried Reginald Brookes, “and drunk
on the street!”</p>

<p>As the others were staring at him, he hastened
to explain, and before he had finished
another peal of the bell startled them.</p>

<p>“This is surely Marion!” cried Dollie,
darting down the stairs.</p>

<p>But once more she was doomed to bitter
disappointment, for half way down the first
flight she met Mr. Ray and his sister, both
pale as ghosts, and Adele almost crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” gasped Dollie, who
thought only of her sister. “Has anything
happened? Have you heard from Marion?”</p>

<p>Not even Miss Allyn thought to introduce
the two gentlemen, but without a moment’s
hesitation Mr. Ray stepped straight up to the
doctor.</p>

<p>“You and Bert must come with me right
away!” he said, quickly. “Miss Marlowe
has been inveigled into an awful trap, and
it depends on us to get her out of it!”</p>

<p>“I’m ready!” cried Bert, clenching his
fists and setting his teeth.</p>

<p>“Lead the way!” said Dr. Brookes, snatching
up his hat immediately.</p>

<p>“Have you a revolver?” was Mr. Ray’s astonishing
question.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn rushed to her trunk and
brought out a small weapon.</p>

<p>“I keep it for burglars; it’s better than
nothing,” she said, briefly; “but how about
the police? Can’t they aid you in this
matter?”</p>

<p>“They would only bungle it,” was Mr.
Ray’s evasive reply. “Marion has been
lured into the apartments of a wicked woman
and while I do not fear that she will meet
with bodily harm——”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn interrupted him before he
could finish.</p>

<p>“Go, at once!” she said, quickly, “we will
be calm and wait for you.”</p>

<p>As the three young men tramped noisily
down the stairs, poor, frightened Dollie went
promptly into hysterics.</p>

<p>“Hush! Don’t cry, Dollie!” said Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Allyn, sternly. “If those three young men
who love Marion cannot save her, I shall
be greatly mistaken; besides, if you cry so
you will not be able to hear what Miss Ray
tells me, and I am sure you wish to know
what has happened to your sister!”</p>

<p>Dollie stifled her sobs, and wiped her
eyes.</p>

<p>In a few moments she was quiet and
ready to listen.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all I know as quickly as
possible,” Adele Ray said, brokenly; “and
Oh, girls, I want your sympathy for my
poor, dear brother!”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3 title="VII. A BROTHER’S STORY">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>A BROTHER’S STORY.</small></h3>

<p>Adele Ray was as pale as death when she
spoke again, but her hands were clenched in
a resolute manner.</p>

<p>She was a woman of twenty-five, whose
life had been a sad one, and her handsome
face was marred by lines of grief and bitterness.</p>

<p>In a low, vibrating voice she told her
story, making it as brief as possible so as
not to distress them.</p>

<p>“My dear brother has had a bitter experience,”
she said, “for, like many a thoughtless
youth he became enamored with a young
girl while he was a boy at college, and without
any of us knowing it he made her his
wife. She was a vain, silly creature, who
looked like a big wax doll, and in less than
a year Archie discovered that she was faithless.
He left her at once, but made her a
generous allowance—he had money of his
own, and no one asked him to account for it.
One more year passed and he heard that the
girl was dead—he took pains to prove it and
considered the reports verified. Meanwhile
not one of his family knew it. When he
came home from college he was only twenty,
and to think, my brother thought himself a
widower.”</p>

<p>There were tears running down her face
as she paused for a moment. Dollie had forgotten
to weep, she was so interested in the
story.</p>

<p>“It was in London, six weeks ago, that the
awful revelations occurred,” she went on
after a minute. “Archie and I were walking
together on the Strand one day when all of
a sudden he gripped my arm and the next
moment he dropped—he had fainted like a
woman. I had only time to see that a young
‘bleached blonde’ was passing us; after that,
for an hour, I was busy with my brother.
Well, to make this story short, Archie told
me everything. He had to, you see, for the
blonde woman was his wife—he recognized
her instantly—she was living!”</p>

<p>“How horrible!” cried Miss Allyn, as Miss
Ray stopped speaking. She had thought
just then of what Dr. Brookes had said and
was beginning to put “two and two” together.</p>

<p>“Oh, and I thought he loved Marion!”
burst out Dollie impetuously. “I was as
sure as anything that she would marry him
some time.”</p>

<p>“That is the hardest part of it! He does
love her,” sighed Miss Ray, “but I was obliged
to tell her his miserable secret, and it
is that which has brought her into this awful
trouble.”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn said nothing, but Dollie cried
out in astonishment.</p>

<p>“She has a picture of Archie’s wife that I
gave her,” explained Miss Ray, “and she
promised to watch for and to try and save
her. You see, Mary, Archie’s wife has gone
to the bad altogether, and of course we feel
pretty sure that she will drift to Blackwell’s
Island, and in case that happens we thought
Marion would see her, and oh, to think that
the woman should have tricked us. For it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>was she, my brother’s shameless wife, that
Marion tried to rescue to-day, and now to
think that the dear girl is in her power and
she knows, that drunken creature, that
Archie is in love with her.”</p>

<p>This time even Miss Allyn gave her a
questioning glance, then suddenly Miss Ray
blushed scarlet as she turned her face from
her companions.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, please, for wounding you,”
she said, very softly, “but, Mary, that dreadful
woman is in the constant companionship
of a man who has met Marion here, as your
friend, Miss Allyn. He goes by the name of
George Harris Colebrooke.”</p>

<p>With a little groan Miss Allyn rose from
her chair.</p>

<p>“The black-hearted scoundrel!” she muttered,
savagely. “And he hates her, Miss
Ray; because she was loyal to me George
Colebrooke hates her.”</p>

<p>Dollie burst out crying again and it took
both women to comfort her. She was now
thoroughly alarmed about the condition of
her sister.</p>

<p>She had entirely forgotten the doctor’s
allusion to “May Osgood,” but Miss Allyn
was pondering it over and over in silence.</p>

<p>It was almost midnight when the three
young men returned, but they came triumphant,
bringing Marion with them.</p>

<p>“Put her right to bed,” said Dr. Brookes,
authoritatively. “The poor girl is worn out
from this evening’s experience. If the shock
is not too great she will be all right to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I am all right now,” cried Marion, decidedly,
as she insisted upon walking to a
chair unsupported. “Oh, what a dreadful
experience it has been. To think that I was
only trying to do the woman a kindness and
she deliberately connived to get me in to her
rooms in order that I might be insulted by—by
that villain!”</p>

<p>“We all know who you mean!” said Miss
Allyn, promptly. “George Colebrooke hates
you, and the woman is his friend! Oh, how
could I ever have been so deceived—so foolish
as to trust him.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven you are done with him!”
said Marion gladly, then she glanced at her
rescuers with a pitiful look, but she could not
yet understand Mr. Ray and the doctor being
together.</p>

<p>She was very pale and almost radiantly
beautiful as she said good-night to her
friends a little later. If there was any preference
in her heart for either of these noble
young men, there was not an expression or
glance to show it.</p>

<p>As Dr. Brookes said good-night and
walked away by himself he had fully decided
that Bert’s information was erroneous—if
that woman was Mrs. Ray, how could she
be “May Osgood?”</p>

<p>“Marion, I believe you are a coquette,”
said Miss Allyn, when the girls were alone.
“I don’t see how else you could possibly be so
entirely neutral.”</p>

<p>“I act as I feel,” said Marion, simply, “I
don’t know which I like best and to-night I
am too tired to think—they were both as
brave as lions and Bert held his own with
them nobly.”</p>

<p>After the three girls were in bed Marion
told them what had happened. She had
only to speak distinctly, for Miss Allyn’s
bed-room was adjoining.</p>

<p>“I knew her by her picture, and, of course,
I remembered my promise,” she began, “and
I am sure she must have known me by some
means or other, for she began eyeing me
very curiously as soon as she was in the carriage.
When we got to her house she
pleaded helplessness,” she continued, “so I
assisted her up the stairs in spite of my weak
condition. Then the moment we were in her
flat she burst out laughing. In a second she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>had locked the door and I was a prisoner.
Of course I demanded to be let out, but she
said she was Archie Ray’s wife and that
I was his sweetheart and that she would
smirch my reputation so that he would never
again care for me. At that very minute who
should come from another room but George
Colebrooke and another man, both fairly
reeking with liquor.</p>

<p>”I was horribly frightened, but I did not
show it. I demanded to be let out. They
only laughed at me. Then one of them put
his arms around me and held me tightly
while the woman mixed something in a glass
and Colebrooke tried to make me swallow
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion, what did you do?” gasped
Dollie, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Marion smiled a little, now that the frightful
thing was over.</p>

<p>“Why, I bit his hand so badly that he
dropped the glass,” was her answer, “and
just at that second the door was burst in
and the next thing I knew my friends were
all there and that fellow Colebrook had vanished
like magic.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3 title="VIII. A VISIT TO THE MORGUE">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>A VISIT TO THE MORGUE.</small></h3>

<p>Two days later Marion was on her way
back to Charity Hospital. She had been absent
from duty for a week, but they had all
heard of her injury and been most kind and
sympathetic. This time, as she passed down
Twenty-sixth street, Archie Ray was with
her. He had been first in the offer of escort
on this occasion.</p>

<p>As they rode slowly along in Mr. Ray’s
private carriage, Marion could see that his
face had grown wonderfully sad. It was
not like the face that she had recalled so vividly
that night when Dr. Brookes had told
her that he loved her.</p>

<p>“You are grieving terribly, Mr. Ray,” she
said to him, sweetly. “Do, please, try to look on
the bright side a little. There is surely
some way of ridding yourself of that woman.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in divorce?” asked Mr.
Ray, suddenly.</p>

<p>“I most certainly do,” was Marion’s
prompt answer. “I believe in anything that
will undo an error.”</p>

<p>“You are more just and merciful than the
world at large,” sighed the young man.
“Most people would say, ‘If you married
her, stick to her,’ and I would say so, too,
if the difference was not quite so glaring.”</p>

<p>Marion’s gray eyes grew tender as she
glanced at him shyly. It seemed almost immodest
to her that she should be advising
him in this matter.</p>

<p>“‘For better or worse’ does not mean that,”
she said, very slowly. “When sin and crime
come between husband and wife, it is time
to separate to avoid contamination. No true
man or woman will hold the promise, ‘until
death,’ as indissoluble under such conditions.
It is contrary to all the laws of human nature.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ray listened eagerly. These were his
own thoughts put in words. He was glad,
indeed, that she coincided so completely.</p>

<p>“I promised loyally and honestly,” he murmured,
after a minute, “but I did not dream
that I was marrying a dual character. I
wrecked my whole life by one error. Oh,
can I ever undo it?”</p>

<p>“I certainly should try,” said Marion,
stoutly. “You are too young and too—too
noble to be tied to such a woman.”</p>

<p>The carriage halted as Marion spoke, and
Mr. Ray glanced out of the window to see
what was the matter.</p>

<p>“We are right in front of the Morgue,”
said Marion, looking out. “Oh, I see what
is stopping us; they are loading up the dead
wagon.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>Her companion shivered as he saw a wagon
load of pine coffins about ten feet ahead
of them.</p>

<p>“What a horrible place!” he said. “Have
you ever been in there?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’d like to go if there is time,”
said Marion, quickly. “And I am quite sure
there is. The boat does not leave until
eleven.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ray spoke to the driver and then
helped Marion out. At the same moment another
carriage rolled up and stopped directly
before the entrance.</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Atherton, Dollie’s employer!”
Marion whispered, as she drew back suddenly.</p>

<p>A man had stepped from the other carriage
and gone into the Morgue. She knew
him instantly, although his back was toward
her.</p>

<p>Archie Ray hardly heard the young girl’s
next words. He was staring after the lawyer
with a dazed expression.</p>

<p>“He is the old lawyer who is Dollie’s employer,”
Marion said again, “and he’s a regular
<i>roué</i>, if I am any judge. Why, do you
know, he took Dollie to luncheon one day
and would have taken her to a matinee if I
had not stopped it.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” said Mr. Ray, coming
back to her words, with a start. “Why, that
man is my father-in-law. He is the father of
my wife. Has not his own daughter’s career
made him more merciful of other
maidens?”</p>

<p>Marion was shocked at his news, but there
was no time to reply. The next moment they
were in the dingy home of the dead, gazing
around them with curiosity.</p>

<p>“He did not see us,” whispered Marion, as
the lawyer went out again. “And I am very
glad, for I should not care to speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Dead John,” the keeper, came in at that
moment. He was a little impatient as he
looked at his visitors.</p>

<p>“Be yees lookin’ fer any one in perteckeler?”
he asked, crossly, “fer if yees ain’t, it
ain’t no time ter be comin’ in wen I’m busy.”</p>

<p>“What was he looking for?” asked Mr.
Ray, pointing after the lawyer. “You were
civil enough to him, even if you were busy.”</p>

<p>The man shook his head and became suddenly
better natured.</p>

<p>“He’s lookin’ fer his gal, he sez,” was his
answer. “He ain’t seen her fer years an’ he
comes here lookin’ every mornin’.”</p>

<p>“That’s a queer combination,” said Mr.
Ray, as he put Marion back into the carriage.
“A man who is always hunting the Morgue
on the lookout for his own wayward one,
yet never losing a chance to wrong some
other man’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“I think a little more knowledge of the evil
in the world will drive me mad,” said Marion,
sharply. “Oh, is there no end to it? I
am beginning to be doubtful.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ray looked at her fair face with one of
his old, tender glances.</p>

<p>“It is wrong that you should have learned
even so much as one lesson of the evil,” he
said, softly. “You should have been kept
free from it all, my peerless Marion.”</p>

<p>The beautiful girl’s face flushed scarlet to
the roots of her hair, but Mr. Ray touched
her hand gently, almost in a pleading manner.</p>

<p>“Let me think of you thus—it can do no
harm,” he said, softly. “Let me say to myself,
she is my peerless Marion, even though
a barrier exists between us which prevents
my saying anything more.”</p>

<p>Marion bowed her head and the tears
sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>“You are too good to think so well of me,”
she said, simply. “Oh, I wish you could
know how deeply I sympathize with you.
How sorry I am to know how you have suffered.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>She let her hand rest in his as she looked
at him.</p>

<p>“And you will watch, Marion, for my erring
wife,” he said, sadly; “you will forget
what she has done in your friendship for me,
for I should never forgive myself if she
should be in want or die uncared for.”</p>

<p>“I will watch,” said Marion, simply, and
then the carriage stopped. Once more Marion
was admitted to the little hospital dock,
going back to her duties among the city’s unfortunate.
As she reached the deck of the
<i>Thomas Brennan</i>, some one stepped out of
the pilot house to greet her.</p>

<p>It was young Dr. Brookes, on his way to
the Prison Hospital.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3 title="IX. MARION WITNESSES A QUEER SIGHT">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>MARION WITNESSES A QUEER SIGHT.</small></h3>

<p>“Big Belle, the Confidence Queen,” was a
very versatile woman. At liberty, she was
noted for the variety of her accomplishments,
and in prison walls she was equally
useful both in her cell and in the workroom.</p>

<p>But this strange woman’s greatest delight
was in the care of the sick, and as she
passed from cot to cot in the prison hospital
both her hand and her voice were as gentle
as a mother’s.</p>

<p>She was a large, fine-looking woman, with
brilliant black eyes, but the coarse prison
garb did not enhance the beauty of either
face or figure.</p>

<p>Belle had “done time” at the “Isle de
Blackwell” before, so she felt very much at
home in her present occupation.</p>

<p>There was not a rule or regulation about
the prison that she did not know, and if
she ever longed to break one of them there
was no indication of it in her manner.</p>

<p>Rather, it seemed to her associates that
Belle was merely “biding her time,” and,
according to all accounts, a goodly portion
of her ill-gotten gains was steadily drawing
interest in various banks in anticipation of
her coming.</p>

<p>As Big Belle bent over one of her charges
whose face was covered with bandages, she
moistened them as skillfully as any trained
nurse could have done, and as the prison
physician entered the ward she went over to
him promptly, standing with calmly folded
hands and eyes cast down, the very embodiment
of meekness and servitude.</p>

<p>“How is she this morning?” was the doctor’s
first question, asked without even raising
his eyes from the prescription he was
writing.</p>

<p>“Worse, Dr. Brookes,” said “Big Belle” in
a lady-like voice. “I should say that the vitriol
was still burning deeper, and if I am not
much mistaken there is a considerable fever.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to get you a thermometer,” said
Dr. Brookes, without thinking; “you can certainly
take temperature, Belle, they tell me
you are clever.”</p>

<p>A half-suppressed laugh from the woman
startled him. He looked up and caught her
eye, and then he, too, smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“I keep forgetting that you people aren’t
to be trusted,” he said, pleasantly. “When
will I ever learn that I am working in a
prison!”</p>

<p>The woman did not answer, but she followed
him with her eyes as he moved away.
She was by far too clever not to understand
his words, and by far too unhappy not to be
secretly pleased by them.</p>

<p>“He’d trust me all right, if he dared,” she
thought. “As if there was any danger of my
killing myself, or any one else for that
matter!”</p>

<p>“May I come in a minute?” asked a pleasant
voice at the door.</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes looked around quickly, and a
smile spread over his features. His visitor
was Marion Marlowe, in her nurse’s dress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>and bare-headed, except for the light shawl,
which she was just slipping to her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Come right in,” said the young man, as
he went quickly forward, then stopped suddenly
at the thought of his professional
dignity.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Marlowe, what ward do you
come from, please? I am almost afraid to
make you welcome.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fear,” said Marion, smilingly, as
she stepped into the ward. “Since I came
back from the city, I have only been helping
in the linen room. They have been kind
enough to keep me off the wards until I
grew a little stronger.”</p>

<p>“Big Belle” was just passing on her way
to the vitriol patient and Marion watched
her movements with a look of wonder.</p>

<p>“The cleverest ‘confidence woman’ in the
world,” whispered the doctor. “She counts
the victims she has fleeced by the score, yet
see how gentle she is with my patients.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with her?” asked
Marion, nodding toward the patient with the
bandaged face.</p>

<p>“Why, she was in some drunken fight
with another woman. I believe it was over
some man, and as they left Jefferson Market
Court her rival fairly deluged her with
vitriol. She only came up from the city
yesterday—sent up as a ‘drunk and disorderly’
for ten days only, but she’ll never go
back. She is slowly dying.”</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” sighed Marion, with tears
in her eyes. “But her fate is the same as
dozens that I have seen already. Oh, this
awful island! This awful island!”</p>

<p>She was moving toward the patient when
Dr. Brookes stopped her.</p>

<p>“No, Marion!” he said, firmly; “you must
not go any nearer. Erysipelas has set in
and you know you are still in a weak condition.
If you should catch any infection in
my wards, I would never forgive myself—so
forgive me, please, for being inhospitable!”</p>

<p>“Big Belle” came back and stood quietly
beside the doctor. She had something to
say to him and was awaiting his permission
to speak.</p>

<p>“She wishes me to send for her father,”
she reported as Dr. Brookes turned to her.
“She knows that she is dying, and is anxious
to see him.”</p>

<p>“Get his name,” was the doctor’s answer,
but “Big Belle” smiled sadly. “I tried to,”
she said, quickly, “but she lapsed into unconsciousness
that minute.”</p>

<p>“They may know his name in the office,”
said the doctor. “I’ll go right down now
and see if I can wire him.”</p>

<p>As Dr. Brookes and Marion reached the
door of the building, a breath of salt, fresh
air came over the water.</p>

<p>“What a mockery!” said Marion, with a
heart-felt sigh. “Oh! this place is so beautiful
with its wonderful, changing scenery,
yet how sad are the hearts that dwell in
these buildings. How weary are the eyes
that gaze out on these waters!”</p>

<p>The tramp of many feet came as an echo
to her words. Marion turned, and through
the iron grating saw the convicts marching
to their luncheon.</p>

<p>“Oh! do let me go in and see them!”
she cried, impulsively. “It is the first time
I have been in here, although I have been
a month on the Island.”</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes spoke to the turnkey who at
once opened the great guard doors.</p>

<p>As Marion stepped into the dim corridor,
with its small high windows and bleak
gray walls, she shuddered involuntarily as all
do at their first visit to a prison.</p>

<p>Tier after tier of cells rose above her head
and now that the convicts were on their way
to the dining-room she stood still for a moment
and gazed morbidly into the blackness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>Suddenly there was a cry from the doctor
and a guard came running toward him.</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes pointed with one hand toward
a closed cell just above them, and with the
other tried desperately to push Marion behind
him.</p>

<p>But he was a second too late, for Marion’s
glance had followed his own, and for the
next few minutes both stood speechless with
horror.</p>

<p>A man whose face was so familiar to
Marion that her heart almost stopped beating
when she recognized it, was hanging by
the neck to the door of his cell. In the momentary
excitement of the meal hour he had
seized his opportunity, and when the guard
at last cut him loose he was too far gone
to be resuscitated.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Dr. Brookes, as they
brought him down.</p>

<p>Almost automatically the guard muttered
the dead man’s number, but with ashen lips
Marion gave the information.</p>

<p>“His name is Lawson,” she said, in a
whisper; “and he is the villain who boarded
at my father’s home one summer. He was
a hypnotist by profession, and he abducted
my sister Dollie! He was sentenced to Sing
Sing, so I had no idea that I would see him
here.”</p>

<p>The guard explained that he had been
transferred to the Island by special order,
only a few days previously.</p>

<p>Reginald Brookes bit his lips in a burst
of anger.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he said, humbly; “I had
no idea you bore such sorrow. Thank
Heaven he has paid the penalty and yes—I
am glad that you saw it.”</p>

<p>“I am, too,” said Marion, who was
deathly pale. “If it had to be—I am glad
that I saw it.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3 title="X. A CONVICT’S CONFIDENCE">CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>A CONVICT’S CONFIDENCE.</small></h3>

<p>That very afternoon Dr. Brookes got a letter
from Dr. Greenaway. It was the first time
he had heard from him since he loaned him
the five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“Poor chap! He little knows what a
shock I had,” he thought, “when for a moment
I thought I had discovered his sweetheart
in that drunken woman!”</p>

<p>He tore open the letter and read it hastily.
It was very brief and only took a minute.</p>

<p>“I am nicely settled,” wrote Greenaway,
“and would be perfectly happy, but my
sweetheart has thrown me over—jilted me—to
be honest. Of course you will think that
if I can talk of it I do not suffer, but at just
this minute I must talk or die, and you, doc,
are my friend, the only one I have in creation.
Yes, May has left me and gone, I
don’t know where, but to be honest again, I
think it is to the devil! She was always gay,
but I trusted her, doc, even while she was
abroad for three months. I did not doubt
her, but now there is no use denying it any
longer, she is a bad, dissolute woman—and
yet I love her!”</p>

<p>There was a little more to the doctor’s
strange letter, but it was the postscript that
Dr. Brookes remembered longest and wondered
most over.</p>

<p>“I haven’t forgotten the name of your little
nurse-friend, yet, doc,” it said, “for I have
a curious presentiment, in some way, that
some sorrow will come to me through Miss
Marion Marlowe!”</p>

<p>“As queer as ever—queerer, perhaps,”
muttered Dr. Brookes as he finished the
letter.</p>

<p>Then as he went about his work in the
meagerly furnished wards he found himself
wondering if Greenaway was going crazy.</p>

<p>“What a fool to throw himself away on a
woman like that!” he said aloud. The next
instant he noticed with embarrassment that
“Big Belle” had heard him.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” thought the doctor, suddenly,
“I am going to talk to this woman. Prison
rules be hanged! She is a human being, and
if any one knows the world this woman
knows it.”</p>

<p>He turned toward her instantly—there
was no one within hearing.</p>

<p>“Belle,” he said, quietly, “tell me something
of your life. I want to know your motive
for being dishonest.”</p>

<p>The woman stared at him a moment, and
then smiled broadly. There was a vestige of
her old shrewdness in the way she answered
him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>“I have never been proven dishonest,” she
said, quietly. “I came up this time on the
strength of my reputation, but, granted that I
am dishonest, this is my only motive, I wish
to hold my own in the struggle of life—I am
what you might call a rabid believer in the
‘survival of the fittest.’”</p>

<p>“But how long do you expect to survive?”
he asked quickly, “and do you call your present
existence living?”</p>

<p>“I have some money,” said the woman
quietly, “and this fortune is put away where
no law can touch it. I have fifteen years
yet before I shall be fifty-five; more of those
years I expect to spend in prison, but after
that——”</p>

<p>She stopped a moment and chuckled before
she added:</p>

<p>“After that I presume I shall enter society.”</p>

<p>To save himself, the doctor could not help
laughing. He was amused, to say the least,
at this woman’s philosophy.</p>

<p>“You seem to have no fear of results,” he
said after a minute. “What was your early
training? Were your parents religious?”</p>

<p>For once “Big Belle’s” eyes snapped with
a hidden fire. He had touched the chord that
was most responsive.</p>

<p>“I was a country girl like that nurse who
was in this morning,” she said, quickly; “I
came to the city because my parents could not
support me. I was only one of the thousands
who are kicked out at an early age to battle
with the world’s evils, and oh, how I was
tossed and buffeted about! How readily my
superiors made a football of me! How willingly
women inveigled me into foolish ways,
and how quickly and thoroughly they abused
me for being inveigled! I was a fresh field
daisy, innocent as a lamb, but oh, how gladly
men sullied the whiteness of my soul, how
eagerly they flattered me and led me astray,
and then, when I was as they were, how brutally
they served me! There were times when
I thought I would gladly die, Dr. Brookes,
but there was something in me that kept urging
and urging, and at last I turned, as a
worm will turn, and yes, I will tell you, my
motive was to get even!”</p>

<p>The black eyes were scintillating with fury
now, and Dr. Brookes almost regretted that
he had stirred up such a passion.</p>

<p>“I don’t entirely blame you,” he said quietly,
“and yet I know that you are wrong. It is
better to suffer than to persecute—apart from
all religious sentiment, I believe that thoroughly!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t!” said the woman in a cold,
hard voice. “I prefer to take things as they
come, Dr. Brookes, and you cannot say that
I do not take my punishment philosophically.”</p>

<p>They were at one end of a long ward when
this conversation took place; five minutes
later they were both bending over a patient.</p>

<p>“You can take the bandages off now,
Belle,” said the doctor, softly. “Poor soul,
she is dying and perhaps she will be more
comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Did you learn her name?” asked the female
convict.</p>

<p>“No, she came as Mary Jones, which means
absolutely nothing. We have wired to the
police for further information.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will come too late, I’m afraid,”
said the woman softly. The patient had
breathed her last before she had fairly removed
the dressings.</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe was standing by a window
in Charity Hospital, watching the setting
sun just as the “vitriol patient’s” remains
were taken to the criminal “dead-house.”</p>

<p>Little did she dream what tragedy had been
enacted, or how closely connected was her life
with this poor creature’s.</p>

<p>She was thinking of Mr. Ray and his great
grief as she stood there, and it was only the
stroke of the bell that roused her from her
reverie.</p>

<p>As she passed through the corridor on her
way to the dining-room an office assistant
came along with a handful of letters.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you one for me?” asked Marion,
quickly. “I am Marion Marlowe, I’m in the
linen-room at present.”</p>

<p>“You were at the ‘medical,’” said the
young man as he handed her a letter. “There
ain’t much danger of any of us losing track
of you, Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>Marion looked at him quickly, and an admiring
glance rewarded her.</p>

<p>“Prettiest girl in the building,” he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>blandly. “Every man on the Island is in love
with you, Miss Peaches.”</p>

<p>“Convicts and all?” asked Marion, laughing.</p>

<p>“If they ain’t, then they are in the right
place,” was the answer; “but I guess if they
wasn’t they wouldn’t all of ’em be breaking
rules to look at you! Don’t you remember
that fellow that got shot, Miss Marlowe?”</p>

<p>Marion shuddered as she recalled the terrible
scene, and as she walked slowly away
her face paled a little.</p>

<p>It had happened during the first week of
her stay on the Island, and ever since then she
had been trying hard to forget it. Then a
vision of the black-souled Lawson’s tragic end
flitted across her brain and she put up both
hands as if to ward off such pictures.</p>

<p>“That poor convict that jumped into the
water and was shot is to be envied,” she whispered
sadly. “He went down out of sight
beneath the smiling waters, but Lawson, the
abductor, goes to Potter’s Field. It is right!
It is just! He richly deserves it!”</p>

<h3 title="XI. BERT JACKSON TO THE RESCUE">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>BERT JACKSON TO THE RESCUE.</small></h3>

<p>The tragedy of the “vitriol patient’s” death
was almost a tragedy of two cities—the great
city of New York, where crime is conceived
and fostered and the smaller city on Blackwell’s
Island, where crime is punished and
ended.</p>

<p>A few hours after that sad death in the
Prison Hospital, the lawyer, Augustus Atherton,
stood on the steps of his office waiting
for his typewriter, Dollie Marlowe, to join
him.</p>

<p>As he stood there waiting he twisted his
gray mustache idly. His hands were neatly
gloved and his attire stylish and spotless.</p>

<p>“Not a bad looking chap for fifty,” said a
man who was passing, “and do you know,
Dare, he is a great masher—a regular sport
with the ladies.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that his wife left him years
ago,” was the low answer, “and that his
daughter, the one that married young Ray
while he was in college, was quick in striking
the old man’s pace and kept it up until she
went plumb to the devil.”</p>

<p>“Where is she now?” asked the first
speaker, glancing back to see if the lawyer
was still waiting.</p>

<p>“The last I heard she was seen fighting on
the street. I believe her husband or some
friend of his happened to see her, and for the
sake of the family kept the thing quiet.”</p>

<p>As the two men passed on, Dollie Marlowe
came tripping down the steps. She was
dressed in a natty blue cloth suit and looked
more bewitching than ever.</p>

<p>“You are sure I will get home early?” she
said to the lawyer, plaintively.</p>

<p>“Certainly, little one,” was the smiling answer
as he helped her into a carriage.</p>

<p>“Marion Marlowe would be furious if she
knew I was going out with you after all,” she
said after they had started, “and, of course,
my chaperon, Miss Allyn, will think she has
to tell her. Oh, I must manage to get home
early so they will not know anything about
it.”</p>

<p>“Any one would think I was an ogre or a
monster of some sort,” said the lawyer, smiling
down at her, “when really all I am doing
is just giving you a little pleasure. Certainly
there is no harm in a supper in a private room
together.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go to a regular restaurant?”
asked Dollie, shyly. “I think I would prefer
it very much, if you please, Mr. Atherton.”</p>

<p>The wily old lawyer leaned over and smiled
at her before he answered. As he gazed into
her eyes, he took her hand and pressed it
gently.</p>

<p>“My dear child, you are as safe with me as
you would be with your own father,” he said,
purringly. “Do, Dollie, raise those sweet
eyes and tell me that you trust me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do trust you, of course,” said the
girl, a little more bravely, “but I keep thinking
of Ralph, and it makes me nervous.”</p>

<p>“Ralph is the young man whom you are
engaged to, is he not?” he asked, suavely.
“Well, can Ralph give you nice dinners and
take you to theatres, and can he buy you
pretty dresses and jewelry, Dollie?”</p>

<p>“No, he can’t—not now,” said Dolly, a little
sadly. “Ralph is only a book-keeper on fifteen
dollars a week. We mean to be married
as soon as he gets twenty.”</p>

<p>“And I can give you twenty dollars a week
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>for your own self,” said the lawyer, quickly,
“and I will do it, too, Dollie, if you will give
up this fellow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t give Ralph up. Why, I love
him!” cried the girl, sharply. “And I don’t
know why it is that I have come out with you,
Mr. Atherton. I know Ralph would not like
it. Oh, I am sure it is wicked!”</p>

<p>Poor, weak, little Dollie was growing hysterical
now, and the next moment she found
her head resting on her employer’s shoulder.</p>

<p>As the lawyer leaned over to pull down the
carriage blind he became suddenly aware that
some one was looking in at the window.</p>

<p>“The impudence of that fellow,” he muttered
between his teeth. “It is a chap on
horseback, and he was trying to peep,” he explained
to Dollie. The next instant he bent
boldly and pressed a kiss on her forehead.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Atherton, you mustn’t,” cried
Dollie in genuine alarm, but as she tried to
draw herself away from him he only held her
tighter.</p>

<p>“Let go of me this minute,” she gasped,
stamping her foot in anger. Her cheeks were
like roses now and her eyes like purple pansies.
As her lips trembled with anger they
seemed more tempting than ever, and Augustus
Atherton, unable to resist her beauty,
made another attempt to draw her head to his
bosom.</p>

<p>With the frenzy of despair Dollie tore herself
away and as quick as a flash uncovered
the tiny window.</p>

<p>One glance through the pane made her almost
shout for joy, for there, still riding his
mount as close to the carriage as possible, was
Bert Jackson, in all the glory of his lately acquired
finery.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, save me!” shrieked Dollie, and
that second the horses were stopped.</p>

<p>Bert Jackson sprang to the ground and
threw the carriage door open.</p>

<p>“Come out here, you old sinner, and let
me lick you!” he roared as he almost lifted
Dollie to the roadway beside him.</p>

<p>“Go on, driver!” yelled the lawyer, shrinking
back in his seat.</p>

<p>“Not by a darn sight!” bawled Bert, making
a dive into the carriage.</p>

<p>“Quick, Bert! Let him go,” cried Dollie
in dismay. “Oh, stop quick! There’s a lot of
people staring at us already.”</p>

<p>Bert dropped back to the street with a
groan of rage. As the carriage rolled away
he shook his fist at it vigorously.</p>

<p>“I’ll take this car, Bert, and go right
home,” said Dollie, penitently, as Bert was
looking about wondering what to do with her.</p>

<p>“All right, if you will,” said Bert, very
coolly, “my horse won’t lead very well in the
street. I’ll be up this evening to see you,
Dollie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, I am so ashamed,” said Dollie
as he signaled a car. “You won’t tell Marion
or Ralph or Miss Allyn, will you?”</p>

<p>“Not a word,” said Bert with a little grin.
“But I’ll punch that old duffer yet—you see
if I don’t! The idea of his making love to
my future sister!”</p>

<h3 title="XII. MARION SAVES A VICTIM FROM POTTER’S FIELD">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>MARION SAVES A VICTIM FROM POTTER’S FIELD.</small></h3>

<p>Dr. Reginald Brookes had given his last
order for the night, and as he left the Prison
Hospital he bent his steps almost involuntarily
toward the warden’s office. Some way
or other the vitriol patient’s case had interested
him greatly, and he was anxious to
know if any word had been received from the
New York police about her. A large envelope
was handed to him in the office, and almost
identical with his breaking the seal he
asked the warden a question.</p>

<p>“Any further information about Mary
Jones, Mr. Warner?”</p>

<p>The warden turned to his desk and began
looking over his letters, and just then Dr.
Brookes gave a stifled cry of astonishment.
He had drawn a neatly folded paper from the
envelope in his hand, and in an instant he saw
that it was his friend Greenaway’s life insurance
policy.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” He asked the question
mentally, and just then the warden
turned to him.</p>

<p>“Known for a time as May Osgood,” he
said briefly. “Was an actress, but had no
particular reputation.”</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes dropped the envelope and
stared a minute.</p>

<p>“My God!” he said, sharply. “Can that be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>possible! Why, one of my dearest chums is
in love with that woman!”</p>

<p>“Well, she couldn’t have been much,” said
the warden, bluntly. “A ‘drunk and disorderly’
and not a friend to bury her!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bury her myself if this turns out to be
true! I’ll wire Greenaway to-night,” said the
doctor, promptly.</p>

<p>“Can’t identify her now, her face is a
sight,” said the warden again. “That acid
ate clear through to the bone; she must have
been deluged with it.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I shall send for him,” said
the physician slowly, and in a very few minutes
he had sent the message.</p>

<p>After he had left the building the warden
received a communication. It was from the
Chief of Police, giving some further information
about the woman.</p>

<p>“Hem! Looks as if she did have friends
after all,” he growled crossly, then he, too,
wrote a message and had it wired to the city.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the next morning two more
deaths had been reported, and as sometimes
happen, a blunder resulted.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock there were two pine coffins
lying out on the very edge of the upper
dock, both bearing tags and stenciled numbers.</p>

<p>At that hour Marion Marlowe was standing
with the Superintendent of Nurses, listening
to some instructions of a private nature.</p>

<p>“I would go myself if I had time,” the superintendent
was saying, “for I would like to
see Dr. Miller and tell him about it, but you
can be spared and I can’t, Miss Marlowe, and
I’ll consider it a favor if you will do my errand.”</p>

<p>“I am only too glad to be of service to you,
madam,” was Marion’s answer, “and I shall
enjoy the sail up the river, too, as I have
never been farther than Blackwell’s Island.”</p>

<p>“Well, Dr. Miller is at the Homeopathic
Hospital on Ward’s Island,” was the reply,
“and you have only to tell him exactly what I
have told you.”</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe turned away with a respectful
bow, then something occurred to her
and she looked back anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, will there be a boat this
morning, madam?”</p>

<p>The superintendent thought a moment—she
had almost forgotten that.</p>

<p>“You will have to go up on the ‘dead
boat,’ the <i>Fidelity</i>,” she said, decidedly.
“Tell the captain I sent you and it will be all
right. That is due at half-past eleven. You
don’t mind, do you, Miss Marlowe?”</p>

<p>Marion did not even shiver at this ghastly
suggestion. She was fast growing acclimated
to these daily horrors.</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t hurt me,” she said with a
smile. “I can stay on deck, where I will not
see the coffins.”</p>

<p>When the <i>Fidelity</i> stopped, Marion hurried
aboard. She had seen the two pine boxes
and wished to avoid them.</p>

<p>“Bring on those silent passengers!” bawled
the captain, jovially, and as the coffins were
tossed aboard Marion gazed out over the
water.</p>

<p>“Who’ve we got this time?” asked one of
the convict sailors after they had started.
“We’ve all got to make this trip some day,
boys, and I’m cur’us to know what kind of
comp’ny we’ll be keepin’ up yender!”</p>

<p>He made a motion of his head up the river
as he spoke, and Marion sighed as she
thought of these strong men looking forward
to lying in the pauper graveyard.</p>

<p>“Number 1,197 is Sarah Jenks,” read another
convict, “and 1,198 is Mrs. Mary Ray,
both <i>en route</i> via the <i>Fidelity</i> for the trenches
up yonder!”</p>

<p>As the convict stopped speaking he turned
around quickly, for every man on the lower
deck seemed to be staring at something.</p>

<p>Right behind him stood Marion Marlowe,
her cheeks as white as death, while her beautiful
eyes seemed glazed with horror.</p>

<p>“Quick! Let me see that tag!” she whispered
sharply. “Oh, I am almost sure you
must be mistaken!”</p>

<p>In less than a second there was a guard beside
her, but his presence was unnecessary,
for not one of the convicts would have
harmed her.</p>

<p>“It is Mary Ray, all right,” said the guard,
showing her the tag. “Do you know her,
miss? Has somebody blundered?”</p>

<p>“Somebody has blundered, terribly!” said
Marion, more calmly. “That coffin must not
be taken to Hart’s Island, men. Why, I know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>her husband, and such a thing would kill
him!”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder she’s where she is if he
thought so much of her,” muttered one of the
convicts.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” said Marion, sadly.
“It is just as the guard said—somebody
has blundered.”</p>

<p>The captain was consulted, but he was an
obstinate man.</p>

<p>“Can’t do it, nurse! I’ve got orders and I
have to obey them! It’s government biz.
You can’t monkey with the government.”</p>

<p>“It shall never be buried in Potter’s Field,”
said Marion, pointing to the coffin, “for I will
not leave the boat until I have your promise,
captain! You must not refuse me! The
thing would be too awful!”</p>

<p>“I’ll put back, then,” said the captain, after
a moment’s thought. “It won’t take a half
hour, and I guess it won’t matter.”</p>

<p>As they neared the dock they could see a
group of people waiting for them, among
them was Dr. Brookes, waving and shouting
frantically.</p>

<p>“You see they want us to come back!”
cried Marion, triumphantly. “I told you it
was a blunder, and they have discovered it!”</p>

<p>Then the brave, beautiful girl turned suddenly
paler than ever before, for there on the
dock, with his head bent in grief, stood her
friend, Archie Ray, this dead woman’s husband.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3 title="XIII. THE END OF THE TRAGEDY">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>THE END OF THE TRAGEDY.</small></h3>

<p>Marion had kept her promise to watch for
Mr. Ray’s wretched young wife, and it was
her grim determination alone that secured for
the poor creature a Christian burial.</p>

<p>Never to her dying day would the brave
girl forget the scene on that little dock when
the “dead boat” drew alongside with her
dreadful cargo.</p>

<p>“Gently, men!” she cried as a couple of
convicts lifted the pine coffin. “Remember
that all are not so accustomed to these sights
as we are, and this poor creature was once a
beautiful woman!”</p>

<p>The men heard her silently, but they
obeyed her commands. The box was deposited
gently, and then the <i>Fidelity</i> steamed
away again at an order from the official.</p>

<p>Marion’s glance swept hastily over the
group on the dock. They were mostly attaches
of the monstrous prison, but the next
instant her gaze rested upon two manly
forms, and the pathos of the scene brought
tears that blinded her vision. Mr. Ray was
standing like one stricken by some fearful
blow, his arm resting heavily on Dr. Brooke’s
broad shoulder.</p>

<p>“Bear up!” whispered the doctor. “You
have saved her, Ray! She has come back to
you at last, and you must forgive her—in her
coffin.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl! Poor Mary!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ray’s words came brokenly. He had
forgotten the great wrong that this woman
had done him.</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes had to leave him to give an
order about the coffin, and at that instant a
young man wearing a press badge came running
down from the prison.</p>

<p>One of the guards whom he met turned
and pointed toward Mr. Ray, and the next
moment the reporter was close beside him.</p>

<p>“Do you mind giving the details of this
frightful mistake to the New York <i>Daily</i>?” he
asked blandly. “Awfully sorry to distress
you, sir, but, of course, we would like to have
the story.”</p>

<p>“I will give them to you,” said Marion,
stepping up at once. It seemed wicked that
this man should intrude upon Mr. Ray at this
moment.</p>

<p>The reporter turned to her respectfully,
and Mr. Ray thanked her with a look. A moment
later he was again leaning on the arm of
Dr. Brookes, on his way to the Morgue to
identify the body.</p>

<p>Marion told the story as briefly as she
could, but as she mentioned the name of Augustus
Atherton the stolid reporter gave a
long, low whistle.</p>

<p>“He is here, Lawyer Atherton,” he said,
quickly. “He came up in the boat with me,
and he acted like a madman. Every one of
us kept our eyes on him—we thought he was
going to jump overboard.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is a very wicked man!” said
Marion, impulsively, “so I don’t pity him as
much as I do her poor husband!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>“Ray treated her all right for all I can
learn,” said the reporter. “She was a ‘tough
proposition,’ if you know what that means,
but if the father is bad what can you expect
from the children?”</p>

<p>As they were walking back to the Penitentiary,
Marion remembered the errand that she
had been sent on, but she felt sure that the
superintendent would excuse her when she
heard her story.</p>

<p>At the door of the warden’s office even the
reporter halted. The scene in the office was
almost appalling.</p>

<p>Archie Ray and his father-in-law stood
face to face, both pale as death and both glaring
at each other.</p>

<p>In an instant Marion knew that there had
been hot words between them, and that they
were each blaming the other for the day’s experience.</p>

<p>“Come, Mr. Ray,” she said quickly, darting
into the room. “Come away before you break
down altogether! That man’s words should
not annoy you—he is beneath your notice!”</p>

<p>The lawyer glared at her, but did not recognize
her for a moment, while Dr. Brookes
and the warden looked on in intense amazement.</p>

<p>“How dare you speak like that, miss?” said
Augustus Atherton, hotly.</p>

<p>Marion turned and faced him with a look
of indignation.</p>

<p>“I dare, because I know I am right,” she
said, distinctly. “With your own daughter an
outcast, a disgrace to her mother and to her
husband, you do not hesitate to flatter and
mislead young girls, or to compromise and
wrong them if occasion offers!”</p>

<p>The lawyer’s pale face flushed with shame
at her words, and just then Dr. Brookes
stepped forward and led her from the office.</p>

<p>“Well said, beautiful Marion!” he whispered,
softly. “And said at a time that he
will not forget in a hurry! I fancy he will
hesitate before he smiles at another young innocent!”</p>

<p>“You must cheer poor Mr. Ray,” was the
fair girl’s only answer, “for while, of course,
if is impossible that he should still love his
wife, yet there must be memories that make
this scene most bitter!”</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” said Reginald Brookes,
nobly. He had forgotten for the time that
this man was his rival.</p>

<p>Marion hurried back to the hospital. She
had done her duty. She went at once to the
Superintendent of Nurses and told her the
whole story.</p>

<p>“What a horrible thing!” was that lady’s
answer. “Well, my errand will keep, and I
can go myself to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The next day both Marion and Dr. Brookes
got a twenty-four hours’ leave of absence.
They took the “doctor’s boat” together and
went over to the city.</p>

<p>“There has been one more tragedy in connection
with that poor woman’s death,” he
said, sadly, as he handed Marion an open letter.</p>

<p>“My friend, Dr. Greenaway, has killed
himself. It seems he knew Mrs. Ray as ‘May
Osgood,’ and was desperately in love with
her.”</p>

<p>Marion sighed as she handed him back the
letter, which was only a brief account of
Greenaway’s death, written by his friend, Dr.
Fielding.</p>

<p>“How did he hear of it?” she asked, with a
little shudder.</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes looked more sorrowful and his
face trembled as he answered:</p>

<p>“Why, I learned that she was ‘May Osgood’
before I knew she was Mrs. Ray, and, of
course, I wired to Greenaway to come up and
identify her. The fellow was already in a
frightful state! I don’t blame him—it must
be awful to love a wicked woman!”</p>

<p>He was looking at Marion so meaningly
that her eyes fell before his glance.</p>

<p>“Or a wicked man,” she said, softly. “Oh,
how I pity my dear friend, Miss Allyn!”</p>

<p>“It has been a strange ‘mix up,’” said Dr.
Brookes, thoughtfully, “a tragedy, you might
say, of New York and Blackwell’s Island.”</p>

<p>“There are many such, I fancy,” was the
fair girl’s reply.</p>

<p>“More than any one dreams of,” answered
the doctor, sadly.</p>

<p>When they reached the city they went directly
to the flat, and as Dollie met them at
the door Marion uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>Her golden haired sister was looking radiantly
happy, and even young Brookes could
almost guess the secret.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh, Dollie, is it settled at last?” asked
Marion, as she kissed her.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer that question,” said Ralph
Moore, coming forward.</p>

<p>“Mr. Saunders, my employer, has taken
pity on me at last. He has raised my salary
to twenty dollars a week, and now there is no
reason why we shouldn’t be married.”</p>

<p>“And I want them to hurry up about it!”
cried Bert Jackson’s voice, as he and Miss
Allyn emerged suddenly from the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Hello! This looks suspicious!” cried Dr.
Brookes, laughing. “Dollie and Ralph in the
parlor and Miss Allyn and Bert Jackson in
the kitchen!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it don’t mean anything serious,” said
Bert, very coolly. “I’m not proposing to Miss
Allyn, I’m waiting for Marion.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3 title="XIV. A WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>A WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT.</small></h3>

<p>“Well, of all the cool things that I ever
heard!” cried Marion as soon as she could
stop laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, the doctor isn’t the only pebble on the
beach,” went on Bert, gayly. “There are
others—Mr. Ray and myself, for instance!
Of course, I don’t claim to be ‘in it’ just now
exactly, but wait till I get home from college
and then, gee whiz! won’t I give you fellows
a hustle!”</p>

<p>“But perhaps I won’t wait,” said Marion,
mischievously.</p>

<p>Bert shrugged his shoulders with a comical
grimace.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be so mean. I know you,
Marion! You’d die an old maid before you’d
bring such sorrow to this bosom!”</p>

<p>He clasped one hand over his heart and assumed
a tragic attitude. It was plain to be
seen that Bert was developing wonderfully.</p>

<p>“You ought to go on the stage, Bert!” cried
Dollie, as she shook with laughter. “You’d
make a splendid comedian. Oh, you are just
too funny!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I call ‘up-to-date’ criticism,”
said Bert, a little disdainfully. “Right in the
middle of my best tragedy she calls me
‘funny!’”</p>

<p>“But you certainly would make a splendid
actor, Bert,” repeated Miss Allyn. “Do let
me help you to get an engagement.”</p>

<p>“The governor—I mean my newly acquired
pop—wouldn’t hear of it,” said Bert. “He is
going to take me on a trip through Canada in
a day or two, then abroad for the summer,
and goodness knows where else, and then in
the fall I go to college to be fitted for the
ministry, or something.”</p>

<p>There was another shout over Bert’s remarks.
The idea of his even being a minister
was the most amusing thing yet.</p>

<p>“Well, if you were only ordained I would
give you a job at once,” said Ralph Moore,
quickly, “for I am trying to get Dollie to
marry me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why not to-morrow?” asked Dr. Brookes,
gayly. “Both Miss Marlowe and I are on
leave of absence! Oh, Dollie, you must be
married to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Of course you can, sister, dear,” said Marion,
going over to her. “There’s no reason
in the world why you should wait any
longer.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go straight out and find you a flat,”
chimed in Miss Allyn, “and you can both stay
right here until we get it furnished.”</p>

<p>“Then that is settled,” said Bert, who
seemed to be especially anxious, “and there’ll
be one big weight off my mind, I can tell
you!”</p>

<p>He gave Dollie a glance that no one understood
but herself, but the girl’s face flushed
as she remembered that scene in the carriage.</p>

<p>Almost as if she had read her sister’s
thoughts Marion Marlowe spoke after the
laugh had subsided:</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to feel that you are safe,
dearie; that you have a good husband like
Ralph to protect you.”</p>

<p>“And you, Marion, I wish you did not have
to work in hospital!” cried Dollie, impulsively.
“I am sure I don’t see how you can
endure it!”</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes gazed steadily at the fair girl
whom he loved, but the look in her sweet face
did not give him encouragement.</p>

<p>“If you knew how much I was needed in a
hospital,” she said, softly; “how much everybody
is needed who is willing to go and work
for the unfortunates! Dr. Brookes can tell
you what there is to do—what anguish there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>is to soothe, and what wrongs are to be righted!
Suppose I had not been there yesterday,”
she said with a shudder, “just think
what a hideous thing would have happened!”</p>

<p>It was her first allusion to the awful tragedy,
but Marion knew it must come, and she
wished to have it over.</p>

<p>“Oh, sister, what happened?” asked
Dollie, instantly.</p>

<p>Even Bert Jackson paled a little as he heard
the answer.</p>

<p>“I saved Archie Ray’s wife from being
buried in Potter’s Field! She was on the way
there when I found it out; the result is, the
poor creature will now have a Christian
burial!”</p>

<p>“Great Heaven! How horrible!” cried
Ralph Moore, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion, how dreadful!” gasped Dollie,
almost crying.</p>

<p>“Thank God she is dead!” was Miss Allyn’s
low murmur.</p>

<p>“I will tell you about it,” said Reginald
Brookes, bravely. “Poor Miss Marlowe has
borne enough without the pain of this recital.”</p>

<p>There was not a sound in the room as he
described the fearful scenes, but when Lawyer
Atherton’s name was mentioned Dollie
shuddered visibly.</p>

<p>Ralph put his arm around her, and she
leaned her head against his shoulder.</p>

<p>Bert looked surprised and then glad, for he
felt sure that Dollie had told him everything.</p>

<p>And so she had, for Dollie was truthful at
heart. Now that she had found shelter for
her weakness she was almost blissfully happy.</p>

<p>It was Bert who spoke first when the story
was ended, for the fine, manly youth was too
strong willed to be entirely overcome by a
tale of sorrow.</p>

<p>“Well, I am mighty glad that tragedy is
ended,” he said, very soberly. “I’m glad for
the poor woman that she is at rest at last, and
I’m glad that Mr. Ray is free from such a
creature; but, best of all, I am glad you roasted
the old lawyer, Marion, for somehow, ever
since I first saw him I’ve hated the old duffer!”</p>

<p>“Well, I pity him now,” said Marion, softly,
“for his sin has come home to him at last.
There will be nothing but remorse for him in
the future.”</p>

<p>“I heard some news of him this morning
that I forgot to tell you,” said the doctor, soberly.
“A newspaper reporter who knows
him told me that he has left the country. Took
a late train last night without even notifying
his office, he’ll probably remain away until
the thing has blown over, for I see they have
got it pretty straight in all the papers, especially
where they say that he is largely responsible
for his daughter’s doings.”</p>

<p>“Let us try and put all this out of our
minds,” said Miss Allyn, suddenly. “To-morrow
is Dollie’s wedding-day, and we must
all be happy! I move that we have a song—something
rousing and jolly!”</p>

<p>“I second the motion!” cried Bert Jackson,
gayly, as with a great show of triumph he offered
his arm to Marion.</p>

<p>“I score one,” he said joyfully, as he saw
the doctor’s frown of disappointment. “Got
ahead of you that time ‘Sawbones,’ but you
can square it while I’m in Canada!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never take advantage of an absent
foe,” said the doctor, laughing, and just then,
with a great flourish, Bert opened the piano.</p>

<p>Dr. Brookes had never heard Marion sing,
so when the first tones of her magnificent
voice fell upon his ear he almost held his
breath in surprise and admiration.</p>

<p>Bert Jackson winked at him behind her
back, but there was a look on his face that the
doctor had never before seen there.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he thought suddenly, “I believe
the boy does love her! Well, why shouldn’t
he? Who could help it? She is the sweetest,
the noblest, the bravest girl in creation!”</p>

<p>Thus ended another tragedy in Marion
Marlowe’s life—it was a happy termination in
spite of some sadness.</p>

<p>Dollie, her darling sister, was married to
Ralph the next day, and even Archie Ray and
his sister were present at the wedding.</p>

<p>They left the next day for a trip through
the South, but not until after they had followed
Mary Ray’s remains to Greenwood.</p>

<p>There was just one bit of news that distressed
them all, and that was that George
Colebrook was free again and at liberty to
commit such villainies as pleased his base nature.</p>

<p>Lawyer Atherton was never seen nor heard
from again, and of course his offices were
closed and his employees scattered.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn went on with her newspaper
work, and was as loyal as ever to her friends,
and with a grateful heart Marion went back
to the Island, determined to face bravely any
trials that might come to her. As for Dr.
Reginald Brookes, he was patient and hopeful.
Even the prison seemed a palace whenever
Marion, the peerless, entered its portals.</p>


<p class="center big">THE END.</p>


<p class="mt2">In No. 5 of <em class="smcap">My Queen</em>, issued next week,
Marion Marlowe appears as the central character
in a new field of action. The story is
entitled “Marion Marlowe Entrapped; or,
The Victim of Professional Jealousy,” and is
a story of the most thrilling interest.</p>

whose remarkable ability to answer all questions, no matter how delicate the import, will be much appreciated, we feel

<p>“I am in such terrible trouble that I fly to you
for advice, and I do hope you will have the kindness
to answer my questions. I was at the shore
all summer, and I promised three young men
that I would marry them. Of course, I only did it
in fun, but it seems that they have all taken it
seriously. How will I ever get out of such a trying
predicament? I do hate to have them know
that I was only flirting.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Eva L.</span>”</p></div>

<p>The girl who stoops to such unwomanly tricks
as the one you mention deserves to be a little
annoyed and worried. It seems incredible to us
that any girl should make a solemn promise
lightly. To be honest, you will be obliged to confess
your folly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“How much can a girl believe of what a man
says to her? Please answer this question if you
can, Miss Shirley. My gentleman friends are
always praising both my beauty and my grace,
and, oh, the promises that they make, Miss
Shirley! I am constantly being disappointed at
their failures to fulfill them.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lottie G.</span>”</p></div>

<p>My answer to your first question is this: It depends
upon the man. You can believe everything
that a gentleman says to you, and but very little
of what a knave, a rascal or a <i>roue</i> whispers in
your ear. Men who praise you to your face are
nearly always insincere. Men who make promises
easily are apt to forget them easily. We would advise
you to discourage these promises at the moment
they are made. Do not expect anything
from men and then you will not be disappointed.
We suppose, of course, that these promises refer
to engagements like suppers and the theatre, etc.
We cannot imagine what other promises men in
general can be making to a respectable young
girl. We are almost afraid to read between the
lines of your extraordinary letter. We would like
very much to see you so that we could understand
you better.</p>

<p>“I have taken great interest in reading the
correspondence department of ‘My Queen,’ and I
wish to say right here that I know of no one to
whom I would rather tell my troubles than the
author of ‘Marion Marlowe.’ If there is such a
girl as ‘Marion’ in the world, I would like to
meet her. She is a perfect lady without being
prudish or silly. It may sound egotistical, but I
think I am a little like Marion. I am not afraid
to speak out if I think I am right, and I do not
blush or simper over foolish matters. Do you not
think that men admire a sensible woman. One
who can talk reasonably about love and marriage
without squirming, wriggling, blushing and giggling?
Most of the girls I know think it proper
to appear embarrassed and shy the minute a man
makes love to them. I would like very much to
hear your opinion on this subject.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Alma I. C.</span>”</p></div>

<p>You certainly are very much like “Marion
Marlowe,” and that is as great a compliment as
any girl can have paid to her. Any girl who
respects herself can and should talk sensibly
about love and marriage, although it is only fair
to allow her a few blushes. The natural modesty
of a young girl will always make her feel a little
shy in the presence of her lover, but she should
never allow this feeling to prevent her from discussing
the subject of marriage in all its phases
with him after they are sufficiently well acquainted.
No girl should engage herself to a man
until both understand each other thoroughly on
these subjects. I am glad you take an interest in
“My Queen,” as you apparently do, from cover
to cover. We can promise you each week a thrilling
and instructive story.</p>

<p>“I have read one copy of ‘My Queen,’ and
have sent for the others. I am sure Miss Shirley
must be a lovely woman herself to be able to construct
the character of ‘Marion Marlowe.’ I am
very much in love with a young man, and for
that reason I wish to read all about Marion Marlowe,
for I want to see how she talks to her
lovers. I am afraid I am a little inclined to be
silly, but when one loves very deeply is not this
excusable?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ida C.</span>”</p></div>

<p>I am afraid all lovers appear just a little silly
to those who have never experienced the “grand
passion,” Ida, but there is a time and place for
everything, even silliness, so if you do whisper
baby talk in your beloved’s ear you can rest assured
that we shall not blame you. I am glad you
like “Marion” and that you are studying her
character. We intend that she shall be the purest
type of American girl. She will be a good model
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>for all young girls to follow, but we trust that her
imitators will have far less trouble in their lives
than our unfortunate heroine.</p>

<p>“Ever since I met a certain young man a
month ago I have been almost unable to sleep
and have lost my appetite completely. Do you
think I am in love? He is very handsome.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Agnes D.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Loss of sleep and appetite do not invariably
occur from an attack of the “grand passion,”
but they have been known to follow in its wake.
Perhaps your food is not well chosen, and that
you need fresh air and exercise, or perhaps a
tonic. People are frequently deceived in matters
like the one you mention. I would advise you to
study the state of your liver and not lay the
blame on your heart until all the other organs
have demonstrated that they are perfectly normal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am so much in love that I am positively
miserable! I keep thinking that perhaps my
lover will prove false or that something will happen
that I will never marry him. There is hardly
a day or night that I do not picture him dead,
and then the tears roll down my cheeks. I cannot
help it. Do you think he will ever appreciate
such affection as this? Do I not love deeper and
harder than any other woman?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Etta W.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We are sorry to hear that your love is making
you miserable. Love is the great brightener and
beautifier of the world. There should be no instance
where it makes one miserable. We are
afraid you are just a little morbid, Etta, but do
not think for a minute that you are the only little
girl who has ever suffered from such fancies.
When one loves, one is always anxious about the
welfare of the loved one, and a nervous condition
like yours always exaggerates matters.</p>

<p>No, we do not believe you are the “hardest”
lover in the world. Many women have not only
died but given up their lovers, for love, and this,
I am afraid, is far beyond your capabilities.</p>

<p>“I was in Boston last week and went canoeing
on the Charles River. It is a beautiful spot, and
I was astonished at the scores of young girls and
fellows who were out canoeing. My chaperone
called my attention to the vulgar attitudes of
many of the girls who were lying about on the
banks, many of them with their escort’s arms
around them. Of course, being a young girl, I was
terribly shocked, yet the spot was so ideal that I
could hardly blame them. Do you think it is
wrong to yield to such fascinating surroundings?
My chaperone would be shocked if I asked her
such a question.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lottie B.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We know exactly how you felt when you saw
the vulgar display upon the banks of the Charles
River. We have often seen girls and even women
lying about on the seashore in unladylike attitudes,
but it never occurred to us to excuse them
because of “fascinating surroundings.” In the
first place, your chaperone was foolish to call
your attention to it. You might possibly have
not noticed it, and she should not have given you
the opportunity. A girl or woman who assumes
unladylike attitudes in public is a very vulgar
person. We can overlook a little love-making
and sentiment under such conditions, but anything
that borders on vulgarity is not to be tolerated.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been married two years and have lived
in a Harlem flat. In the last three days I have
had my first quarrel with my husband. We were
obliged to move, and he made me do all the
packing; dishes, books, and everything, and it
nearly killed me. I weigh only a hundred pounds,
and am very delicate, while my husband weighs
two hundred and is strong and healthy. I have
decided to leave him if he ever makes me work
so hard again. Do you think I am right? Was he
not very inconsiderate?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Flora F. C.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your husband is probably too stout to do violent
exercise himself, and as you are entirely too
slender, he should have compromised by having
some one to do the work. No woman that we
know is fit to do heavy packing, and you should
have refused firmly when he asked you, and
explained your reasons. If you begin right away,
you may be able to educate him before you move
again. There is nothing much more disgusting to
look upon than a husband who makes a slave of
the wife he has taken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am a very young girl, only fourteen and a
half, and I have no work and cannot get any. A
young man that I know has offered to support
me until I can get a position. Do you think it
would be wrong in me to take his money? I only
need four dollars a week, and he says he can
spare it nicely.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lizzie McC.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We would like very much to have you call upon
us at the office of Messrs. Street &amp; Smith before
you decide to accept the young man’s money.
We have no doubt but that he is perfectly honorable
and can not blame you for considering his
offer in your present distressed condition. Still,
as we said at first, we must see you before advising
you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“When I married a year ago my husband was
getting ten dollars a week, and we seemed to
have no difficulty in paying our expenses. Now
he is getting twelve and we are constantly in
debt, yet the household expenses are no larger
than before. I am sure I do not spend a penny
more than I did a year ago. How am I to find out
where it goes to? I am sure my husband spends
it.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Frances T.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We would advise you to start a petty cash account
and try to get your husband to set down
his expenditures. When you have accounted for
every penny that you have spent during the
week it will be his turn to do the same. If he
refuses, you must talk to him kindly and try to
show him how necessary it is to keep out of
debt. Troubles like that have destroyed the happiness
of innumerable families. There is a leakage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>somewhere in your husband’s pocket-book,
but you can only find it with the aid of tact and
kindness. If you command him to explain he is
likely to be more extravagant than ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am a saleswoman getting ten dollars a
week, and I have a little flat for which I pay
fourteen dollars a month. The expenses are
pretty heavy, and I am often at my wits’ end as
to how I shall pay them. A gentleman whom I
know is anxious to board with me, and says he
will give me five dollars a week for his room
with breakfasts. I am eighteen years old and
very much in love with this gentleman. Would it
be improper for me to take him as a boarder?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Evelyn T. G.</span>”</p></div>

<p>It would indeed be very improper for you to
take the young man to board. Can you not get a
nice, congenial girl friend to go in with you and
bear half of the expense?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Will you kindly answer the following questions
which are worrying me greatly: How can a
girl of fifteen tell when she is really in love, and
how old a man ought she to marry? I have two
lovers, a boy of seventeen and a man of forty. I
like one as well as the other. Which shall I
marry?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Amy.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We think you would be foolish to marry either.
No girl of fifteen is fit to marry. Wait until you
are old enough and wise enough to consider such
a step, and, above all things, wait until you are
sure you are in love. There will be no uncertainty
when the right man comes along. You
should develop your talents and graces in order
to be ready for him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Please tell me if you believe in long engagements?
I have been engaged nine years, and am
beginning to weary of the condition. All of my
girl friends are married, and they are all poking
fun at me. My lover knows this, still he does not
seem to mind it an atom. Is he not unfeeling and
unmanly to keep me waiting?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ellen D.</span>”</p></div>

<p>It is very apparent to us that your lover is not
a lover. He is not worthy of the affection of any
good woman. If he cannot marry you himself
he should take himself out of the way and give
some more enterprising man a chance to win
you. A nine year engagement must be very
stupid. You have our sympathy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am very much perplexed about a simple
matter, and I feel sure that you will help me to
straighten the tangle. A young man who calls
upon me is apparently very much in love with
me, yet in spite of the fact that he has been calling
for three years, he has never said so much as
a word about marriage. I am twenty-five years
old and am getting very anxious. If he does not
propose pretty soon it will drive me to desperation.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Alice C.</span>”</p></div>

<p>You seem to believe that marriage is the chief
end and aim of woman. If you are so anxious to
marry you had better “pop the question” yourself
or else try to get a new lover who will be
more speedy in his declarations. Possibly the
young man has not yet made up his mind as to
your worth as a wife, or possibly he has not
money enough to marry, or some such reason.
Rather than distress yourself farther, I should
certainly ask him his “intentions.” It will at
least “straighten the tangle” and show you
where you stand. If you were thirty-five instead
of twenty-five, there would still be ample time to
marry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am anxious to ask you a question, Miss
Shirley, and I do hope that you will not think I
am silly. I am very fond of kissing, awfully,
awfully fond of it, and I hug and kiss my sweetheart
just as often as possible. My mother says I
am far too forward, and that I will disgust him if
I kiss him so often. I should die to lose him, but
what can I do? The minute I see him I want to
fly at him and kiss him.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Minnie.</span>”</p></div>

<p>My dear Minnie, you are certainly in a very
bad way. Have you never heard the adage that
“familiarity breeds contempt?” There are men
in the world who really enjoy osculatory demonstrations
such as you delight in, but there are
others who prefer an occasional kiss, and, as
your mother says, are disgusted at such frequent
outbursts of affection. We would advise you to
break yourself of the osculatory habit. An occasional
kiss contains far more of the nectar of
bliss than the “continuous performance” which
you seem to indulge in.</p>

<p>A woman cannot be too chary of her kisses before
marriage. After your sweetheart is your
husband, we shall feel very differently. If he has
stood the fire of your affection and crowned it
with matrimony it is safe to suppose that your
temperament pleases him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Will you kindly tell me how I can prove that
my fiance loves me? He often says so, but I
have no way of proving that he speaks truly.
Ought he not to do some noble deed for me, or
are the daily little attentions sufficient proof of
his devotion?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Jane L.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We think that the “little things” of life weigh
far more heavily in the balance than one heroic
action. Both men and women do a heroic deed,
when occasion requires or permits, merely
through the stimulus of danger or the love of excitement,
but it is the truly good man who is
faithful in the “little things,” and smooths the
daily life with his thoughtful attentions. We do
not think you have anything to fear, as your
fiance probably loves you, and he will do the
heroic deed if it is ever necessary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am in great distress of mind, and having
read your good advice to others, I make bold to
come to you in my perplexity. I am not a very
good cook, and my husband knew it before he
married me. He used to say when he was courting
me that anything that was made by my hands
would be heavenly. Now he says a woman is a
fool who does not know how to cook, and he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>positively profane over some of my dishes. I
have tried and tried, and I cannot learn to cook.
I do dressmaking beautifully, and make quite a
little money. Don’t you think he ought to be
willing to hire some one to do the cooking?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Agnes D. B.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We have heard of men like your husband before.
They are a species of human being who
should not be tolerated. A right-minded man
does not marry a woman simply to have her cook
for him, and if that is all he cares about you we
certainly pity you. We would not advise any good
dressmaker to spend her time in learning to
cook; neither would we advise a good cook to
fritter away her hours in trying to master the art
of dressmaking. Every man to his trade, and
every woman, too. If you are helping to support
yourself, you can certainly do about as you
please, and the first thing for you to do is to put
a good girl in your kitchen. Perhaps after your
husband has partaken of a few well-cooked meals
he will be a little more amenable to reason.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been reading the Correspondence Department
of ‘My Queen’ ever since it started,
and am going to add my question to the list. Are
love and jealousy always inseparable? My lover
says they are, and even adds that the greater the
jealousy the greater the love, and when I disagree
with him he says I do not love him. I should be
very glad indeed to hear your opinion.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Evelyn D.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We do not see how true love can leave room for
much jealousy. In order to love truly, one must
have confidence, and with this sentiment in the
heart jealousy cannot flourish. Naturally a person
can feel hurt at any fancied or real slight
from a loved one, but to be genuinely jealous is
to be suspicious, and this sentiment is not compatible
with honest affection. We should be very
“shy” indeed of a jealous man. They have never
proven themselves very desirable companions
for a woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I am deeply interested in ‘Marion Marlowe,’
and have read the Correspondence in every issue.
I would be glad to know who Marion is to marry.
I should have married Archie Ray in the very
first chapter if it had been me. Do you believe,
Miss Shirley, that there are any men like Archie
Ray and Dr. Brookes? If there are, I would give
a great deal to be able to meet them. The men I
know look like mental and moral pigmies in
comparison.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Eva S.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We can not tell you about Marion yet, for she
is a very cautious young lady, and is going to
take a long time to decide whom she will marry.
Mr. Ray and the doctor are certainly very fine
young men, but as they are characters from real
life, we are sure there must be others. We would
advise you to turn your copies of “My Queen”
over to the young men whom you know—perhaps
all they need is an example to follow. If you wait
a few years with your eyes wide open, we have
no doubt but what you will secure a worthy husband
such as we are determined to give Marion
Marlowe when she shows an inclination to accept
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I hope you will not think me foolish for asking
your advice, my dear Miss Shirley, but, really,
I am very much distressed, and I long for some
one to help me. I am a brunette of eighteen
and fairly good looking, yet no young man has
ever asked me to marry him. Several of my
friends have told me that men always prefer
blondes, and that if I should bleach my hair my
chances would be better. Do you think they are
right? I would like to have a lover, and, of
course, I hope to be married, but I should feel
terrible if I should ruin my nice black hair by
bleaching it. Do please advise me what to do in
this matter.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Addie McV.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We do not agree with your friends that men
prefer blondes. On the contrary, both types of
beauty have their special admirers among the
“sterner sex.” If you have “nice black hair” you
should endeavor to retain it as nothing is more
stupid and disgusting than for a woman to attempt
to alter a beauty that nature has given
her. A true man will not love you for the color
of your hair any more than he will for the length
of your nose or the width of your shoulders. If
you are a modest, intelligent girl, the right man
will fall in love with you some day, and then if
you had green hair it would not make any difference.
You are too young to be thinking of marriage,
in any event. Wait until after you are
twenty-one before you even think of a husband.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Faith, it’s mesilf as wud loike to ax yez a
question, Miss Shirley, av ye plaze! I do be a
maid, and a handsome policeman is after makin’
love to me. Sure, phwat will I say to him whin
he axes me to marry the loikes av him? Me
hearrt trimbles so at the thought that me sinsis

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Biddy G.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We suspect “Biddy G” has translated her query
into brogue as a bit of pleasantry. However, the
question asked is quite to the point. If he is a
kind, honorable man, we advise you to say “yes,”
very promptly, Biddy. A good policeman ought
to be a handy article to have in the family. He
ought to be able to guard a nice little, warm-hearted
wife and protect her from all harm. Be
sure that his “record” is good, and then the
“yes” will come easy; but in the words of your
own tongue, “if yez can’t say it aisy, say it as
aisy as ye can.”</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
